# 🔥 Chaos Engineering for Galileo Testing

## Overview

The Chaos Engineering system simulates real-world failures and problematic patterns to showcase:

- **Galileo Observability**: Detect anomalies and issues automatically
- **Galileo Insights**: Surface patterns and suggest fixes
- **Galileo Guardrails**: Block problematic outputs
- **System Resilience**: How the agent handles failures

## Location

**Streamlit Sidebar → 🔥 Chaos Engineering → ⚙️ Chaos Controls**

## Chaos Modes

### 1. 🔌 Tool Instability (25% failure rate)

**What it does**: Randomly fails API calls to simulate network issues

**Simulates:**
- Network timeouts
- Service outages (503 errors)
- Connection refused
- Invalid API responses
- Endpoint unavailability

**Example errors:**
```
"Stock Price API temporarily unavailable (503 Service Unavailable)"
"Connection refused: Stock Price API server not responding"
"Stock Price API timeout after 30 seconds"
```

**Galileo will detect:**
- Sudden spike in tool errors
- Pattern of failed API calls
- Increased error rates

### 2. 🔢 Sloppiness (30% error rate)

**What it does**: Randomly transposes digits in numbers

**Simulates:**
- LLM hallucinations with numbers
- Data entry errors
- Transcription mistakes
- Calculation errors

**Examples:**
```
Original: "The price is $258.06"
Sloppy:   "The price is $285.06"  (5 and 8 transposed)

Original: "Buy 10 shares"
Sloppy:   "Buy 01 shares"  (1 and 0 transposed)

Original: "Total cost: $1,234.56"
Sloppy:   "Total cost: $1,243.56"  (3 and 4 transposed)
```

**Galileo will detect:**
- Hallucinations in numerical data
- Inconsistencies between tool output and agent response
- Factual accuracy issues

### 3. 📚 RAG Disconnects (20% failure rate)

**What it does**: Randomly prevents RAG from loading

**Simulates:**
- Vector database connection failures
- ChromaDB service outages
- Embedding model timeouts
- Document index corruption
- Network issues with vector DB

**Effects:**
- Agent doesn't have access to RAG documents
- Can't answer questions requiring historical data
- Must rely only on tools
- Degrades quality for document-based queries

**Galileo will detect:**
- Missing RAG retrievals in traces
- Quality degradation for certain query types
- Pattern of failures for document-based questions

### 4. ⏱️ Rate Limits (15% failure rate)

**What it does**: Simulates API quota exhaustion

**Simulates:**
- Daily API limit reached
- Per-minute rate limit exceeded
- Quota exhausted errors (429)

**Example errors:**
```
"Rate limit exceeded for Stock Price API. Please try again later. (429 Too Many Requests)"
```

**Galileo will detect:**
- Rate limit error patterns
- Time-of-day usage spikes
- Need for caching or rate limiting

### 5. 💥 Data Corruption (20% corruption rate)

**What it does**: Returns invalid or corrupted data from APIs

**Corruption types:**
- **Wrong prices**: Multiplies price by 0.5x to 2x
- **Negative values**: All changes become negative
- **Missing fields**: Removes random fields (volume, high, low, etc.)
- **Stale timestamps**: Returns very old timestamps
- **Wrong tickers**: Returns different ticker than requested

**Examples:**
```
Request: AAPL price
Returns: Price for "XXXX" ticker (wrong ticker)

Request: TSLA price  
Returns: Price of $876.00 (real: $438.00 - 2x corruption)

Request: NVDA data
Returns: Missing "volume" field
```

**Galileo will detect:**
- Data quality issues
- Inconsistent responses
- Missing required fields
- Anomalous values

## How to Use

### In Streamlit UI

1. **Run app**: `streamlit run app.py`
2. **Sidebar** → "🔥 Chaos Engineering"
3. **Expand** "⚙️ Chaos Controls"
4. **Check** the chaos modes you want to enable
5. **Chat** and see chaos in action!

### Quick Chaos Test

**Enable all chaos:**
1. ✓ Tool Instability
2. ✓ Sloppiness
3. ✓ RAG Disconnects
4. ✓ Rate Limits
5. ✓ Data Corruption

**Then ask**: "What's the price of AAPL?"

**Possible outcomes:**
- ✅ Works fine (chaos didn't trigger)
- 🔌 API failure error
- 🔢 Price with transposed digits ($285.06 instead of $258.06)
- 💥 Corrupted data (wrong price, missing fields)
- ⏱️ Rate limit error

### For Experiments

Chaos modes carry over to experiments:

```bash
# Enable chaos in UI, then run experiment
python experiment_cli.py --inline --experiment chaos-test
```

**Each row** has independent chance of chaos, creating varied patterns!

## What Galileo Will Detect

- Missing required fields
- Stale or invalid data

**Alert on:**
- High error rates
- Repeated failures
- Quality degradation

## Example Interactions with Chaos

### Scenario 1: Tool Failure

```
You: What's the price of AAPL?

Agent: [Tries to call get_stock_price tool]
       [🔥 API fails with timeout]
       
       I apologize, but I'm currently unable to retrieve the 
       stock price due to a technical issue (Stock Price API 
       timeout after 30 seconds). Please try again in a moment.
```

### Scenario 2: Number Transposition (Hallucination)

```
You: What's the price of NVDA?

Agent: [Calls tool, gets price: $189.11]
       [🔥 Transposes to: $198.11]
       
       The current price of NVIDIA (NVDA) is $198.11 per share.
       ❌ HALLUCINATION! Actual price was $189.11
```

### Scenario 3: Data Corruption

```
You: Get me the price of TSLA

Agent: [Calls tool, gets price: $438.69]
       [🔥 Corrupts to 2x: $877.38]
       
       Tesla (TSLA) is trading at $877.38 per share.
       ❌ WRONG! Actual price is $438.69
```

### Scenario 4: RAG Disconnect

```
You: What was Costco's Q3 revenue?

Agent: [Tries to use RAG]
       [🔥 RAG disconnected]
       
       I apologize, but I'm unable to access the document database 
       at this moment. I don't have that information available.
```

### Scenario 5: Multiple Chaos Events

```
You: Buy 10 shares of AAPL

Agent: [Gets price: $258.06]
       [🔥 Transposes to: $285.06 in response]
       [🔥 Also corrupts data: wrong ticker]
       
       Transaction Details:
       - Stock: XXXX  ← Wrong ticker!
       - Shares: 10
       - Price: $285.06/share  ← Transposed!
       - Total: $2,860.60  ← Wrong calculation!
       
       Do you wish to proceed?
       
       ❌ MULTIPLE ISSUES! Galileo should flag this!
```

## Configuration

### Chaos Rates (Adjustable in code)

```python
# In chaos_engine.py
chaos.tool_failure_rate = 0.25      # 25% API failures
chaos.sloppiness_rate = 0.30        # 30% number errors
chaos.rag_failure_rate = 0.20       # 20% RAG disconnects
chaos.rate_limit_rate = 0.15        # 15% rate limits
chaos.data_corruption_rate = 0.20   # 20% data corruption
```

### Via UI

Currently rates are fixed, but you can enable/disable each mode independently.
