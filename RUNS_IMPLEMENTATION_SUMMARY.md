# Dataset Runs Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a new **Runs** tab in the Streamlit UI that allows users to pull datasets from Galileo and run them through the agent with configurable cycling, creating real production logs.

## What Was Built

### 1. New UI Tab: "Runs" (ðŸ”„)

Located as the third tab alongside Chat and Experiments, provides a complete interface for:
- Dataset selection (Galileo, CSV, inline)
- Run configuration
- Progress monitoring
- Results display

### 2. Core Functionality

#### `run_dataset_background(run_config)`
Processes datasets through the agent with the following features:
- Fetches datasets from Galileo (by name or ID)
- Supports CSV uploads and inline data
- **Cycles through dataset multiple times** (configurable 1-100x)
- Creates separate Galileo session for each query
- Tracks progress with detailed status updates
- Error handling with graceful continuation

#### `render_runs_tab()`
Complete UI implementation with:
- Dataset source selection (4 options)
- Run configuration form
- Active settings display (chaos & guardrails)
- Real-time progress tracking
- Results summary with metrics
- Comprehensive help documentation

### 3. Key Features Implemented

âœ… **Multiple Dataset Sources**
- Galileo Dataset (by name)
- Galileo Dataset (by ID)
- Sample test data (5 queries)
- CSV file upload

âœ… **Cycling Mechanism**
- User configurable: 1-100 cycles
- Each cycle processes entire dataset
- Total logs = dataset_size Ã— num_cycles
- Example: 10 rows Ã— 3 cycles = 30 total logs

âœ… **Session Grouping**
- **Multi-turn mode**: All queries in one Galileo session
- **Single-turn mode**: Each query gets its own session
- User selectable via radio button
- Affects session creation and agent lifecycle

âœ… **Settings Integration**
- Automatically honors chaos engineering settings
- Respects guardrails configuration
- Uses live data toggle settings
- Displays active settings before run

âœ… **Real Log Creation**
- Each query creates a real Galileo session
- Full agent traces with tool calls and RAG
- Not experiment logs - production-style logging
- Unique session IDs for each query

âœ… **Progress Tracking**
- Cycle-by-cycle progress
- Row-by-row updates
- Total queries processed count
- Status: queued â†’ running â†’ completed/failed

âœ… **Error Handling**
- Validation before running
- Graceful error handling during processing
- Detailed error messages and tracebacks
- Continues processing on individual failures

### 4. UI Components

**Dataset Selection Section**
- Radio buttons for source selection
- Dynamic input fields based on selection
- CSV preview for uploaded files
- Sample data info display

**Configuration Form**
```
- Run Name (auto-generated with timestamp)
- Number of Cycles (1-100)
- Active Settings Display:
  - Guardrails status (enabled/disabled)
  - Chaos modes count
```

**Progress Display**
- Real-time status updates
- Progress messages
- Results summary with metrics
- Links to Galileo Console

**Help Section**
- How it works explanation
- Difference from experiments
- Use cases
- Step-by-step guide
- Resources and links

## Technical Implementation

### File Modified
- `app.py` - Added ~400 lines of code

### Functions Added
1. `run_dataset_background(run_config)` - Core processing logic
2. `render_runs_tab()` - UI rendering

### Integration Points
- Uses existing `AgentFactory` for agent creation
- Integrates with `galileo_context` for session management
- Leverages `galileo.datasets.get_dataset()` for data fetching
- Shares chaos and guardrails instances from sidebar

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quick Test
```
1. Go to Runs tab
2. Select "Sample Test Data"
3. Set cycles = 1
4. Click "Start Run"
Result: 5 logs in Galileo
```

### Example 2: Chaos Testing
```
1. Enable chaos modes in sidebar
2. Load Galileo dataset "finance-chaos-test" (10 rows)
3. Set cycles = 5
4. Click "Start Run"
Result: 50 logs with chaos patterns
```

### Example 3: CSV Upload
```
1. Upload CSV with 20 queries
2. Set cycles = 3
3. Click "Start Run"
Result: 60 logs from your custom queries
```

## Differences from Experiments

| Aspect | Runs | Experiments |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Function | `agent.process_query()` | `run_experiment()` |
| Logging | `galileo_context.start_session()` | Experiment framework |
| Output | Real session logs | Metric scores |
| Purpose | Production logs, testing | Evaluation, A/B testing |
| Metrics | None | Automatic scoring |

âœ… UI components structured correctly

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements for future consideration:
- [ ] Ability to pause/resume runs
- [ ] Background processing with status polling
- [ ] Export run results to CSV
- [ ] Schedule runs for later
- [ ] Run comparison view
- [ ] Integration with Galileo Insights API
