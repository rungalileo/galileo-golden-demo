# Common Medical Conditions - Clinical Reference Guide

## Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

### Overview
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels due to insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. It affects approximately 10% of the adult population worldwide.

### Symptoms

## Hyperlipidemia (High Cholesterol)

### Overview
Hyperlipidemia is characterized by elevated levels of lipids in the blood, including cholesterol and triglycerides. It is a major modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

### Lipid Panel Values
Normal ranges:
- Total cholesterol: <200 mg/dL
- LDL cholesterol: <100 mg/dL (optimal)
- HDL cholesterol: >40 mg/dL (men), >50 mg/dL (women)
- Triglycerides: <150 mg/dL

### Risk Stratification
Very high risk: Known ASCVD, diabetes with target organ damage
High risk: LDL ≥190 mg/dL, diabetes age 40-75, 10-year ASCVD risk ≥20%
Moderate risk: 10-year ASCVD risk 7.5-19.9%
Low risk: 10-year ASCVD risk <5%

### Treatment
Lifestyle modifications:
- Heart-healthy diet (Mediterranean or DASH diet)
- Reduce saturated fat (<7% of total calories)
- Eliminate trans fats
- Increase dietary fiber (10-25 g/day soluble fiber)
- Regular physical activity (150 min/week)
- Weight management
- Avoid tobacco

Pharmacologic therapy:
Statin therapy (intensity based on risk):
- High-intensity: Atorvastatin 40-80 mg, Rosuvastatin 20-40 mg
- Moderate-intensity: Atorvastatin 10-20 mg, Simvastatin 20-40 mg
- Low-intensity: Simvastatin 10 mg, Pravastatin 10-20 mg

Alternative/add-on therapies:
- Ezetimibe 10 mg daily

- Assess adherence and lifestyle modifications

### LDL Goals
- Very high risk: <70 mg/dL
- High risk: <100 mg/dL
- Moderate risk: <130 mg/dL

## Hypothyroidism

### Overview
Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, leading to a slowed metabolism. It is more common in women and older adults.

### Symptoms
- Fatigue and weakness
- Weight gain
- Cold intolerance
- Constipation
- Dry skin and hair
- Hair loss
- Depression
- Muscle aches and stiffness
- Elevated cholesterol
- Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
- Memory problems
- Menstrual irregularities

### Causes
- Hashimoto's thyroiditis (autoimmune)
- Post-thyroidectomy
- Radioactive iodine treatment
- Medications (lithium, amiodarone)
- Iodine deficiency (rare in developed countries)
- Pituitary or hypothalamic disorders

### Diagnosis
Laboratory tests:
- Elevated TSH (>4.5 mIU/L)
- Low free T4 (<0.8 ng/dL)
- Thyroid antibodies (TPO antibodies for Hashimoto's)

Subclinical hypothyroidism:
- Elevated TSH with normal free T4
- Consider treatment if TSH >10 or symptoms present

### Treatment
Levothyroxine (synthetic T4):
- Starting dose: 1.6 mcg/kg/day (typically 50-100 mcg daily)
- Elderly or cardiac patients: Start low (25-50 mcg) and titrate slowly
- Take on empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before breakfast
- Avoid taking with calcium, iron, or antacids (separate by 4 hours)

### Monitoring
- Check TSH 6-8 weeks after starting therapy or dose change
- Once stable, check TSH annually
- Adjust dose by 12.5-25 mcg based on TSH levels

### Target TSH
- Generally 0.5-2.5 mIU/L
- Individualize based on age and comorbidities
- Pregnancy: TSH <2.5 mIU/L in first trimester

## Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

### Overview
CAD is characterized by atherosclerotic plaque buildup in the coronary arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. It is the leading cause of death in developed countries.

### Risk Factors
Non-modifiable:

- Male gender
- Family history of premature CAD
- Personal history of atherosclerotic disease

Modifiable:

- Obesity (BMI ≥30)
- Physical inactivity
- Unhealthy diet

### Clinical Presentation
Stable angina:
- Predictable chest discomfort with exertion
- Relieved by rest or nitroglycerin within 5 minutes
- Pressure, squeezing, or tightness sensation

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS):
- Unstable angina: Rest angina or crescendo pattern
- NSTEMI: Troponin elevation without ST elevation
- STEMI: ST-segment elevation on EKG

### Diagnosis
- EKG: May show ST changes, Q waves, or arrhythmias
- Cardiac biomarkers: Troponin I or T
- Stress testing: Exercise EKG, nuclear imaging, or stress echo
- Coronary angiography: Gold standard for diagnosis
- CT coronary angiography: Non-invasive alternative

### Medical Management
Antiplatelet therapy:
- Aspirin 81-325 mg daily
- P2Y12 inhibitors (Clopidogrel, Ticagrelor) for ACS or post-PCI

Anti-ischemic medications:
- Beta-blockers (e.g., Metoprolol 25-200 mg twice daily)
- Calcium channel blockers (if beta-blockers contraindicated)
- Long-acting nitrates (e.g., Isosorbide mononitrate)
- Ranolazine for refractory angina

Lipid-lowering:
- High-intensity statin therapy
- Goal LDL <70 mg/dL

ACE inhibitors or ARBs:
- Especially if heart failure, diabetes, or LV dysfunction

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Smoking cessation (most important)
- Mediterranean diet
- Regular exercise (cardiac rehabilitation)
- Weight management
- Blood pressure control (<130/80 mmHg)
- Diabetes management (HbA1c <7%)

### Monitoring

## Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

### Overview
CKD is defined as kidney damage or decreased kidney function (GFR <60 mL/min/1.73m²) for 3 or more months. It affects approximately 15% of adults and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

### Stages of CKD (based on eGFR)
- Stage 1: eGFR ≥90 with kidney damage
- Stage 2: eGFR 60-89 with kidney damage
- Stage 3a: eGFR 45-59
- Stage 3b: eGFR 30-44
- Stage 4: eGFR 15-29
- Stage 5: eGFR <15 (kidney failure)

### Causes
- Diabetes mellitus (leading cause)
- Hypertension
- Glomerulonephritis
- Polycystic kidney disease
- Prolonged obstruction
- Recurrent kidney infections
- Medications (NSAIDs, certain antibiotics)

### Symptoms
Early stages often asymptomatic. Advanced disease may present with:
- Fatigue
- Poor appetite
- Trouble concentrating
- Muscle cramps
- Swelling of feet and ankles
- Puffiness around eyes
- Dry, itchy skin
- Frequent urination
- Nausea and vomiting

### Diagnosis
- Serum creatinine and eGFR calculation
- Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)
- Urinalysis
- Renal ultrasound
- Consider kidney biopsy if etiology unclear

### Management
Blood pressure control:
- Target <130/80 mmHg
- ACE inhibitors or ARBs preferred (reduce proteinuria)

Diabetes management:
- Target HbA1c <7% (individualize)
- SGLT2 inhibitors have renal protective effects

Lipid management:
- Statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction

Dietary modifications:
- Protein restriction (0.8 g/kg/day in stage 3-5)
- Sodium restriction (<2 g/day)
- Potassium restriction if hyperkalemia
- Phosphorus restriction in advanced disease

Medication adjustments:
- Dose adjust medications based on eGFR
- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, aminoglycosides)

Complications management:
- Anemia: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, iron supplementation
- Metabolic bone disease: Vitamin D, phosphate binders
- Hyperkalemia: Dietary restriction, medications
- Volume overload: Diuretics, fluid restriction

### Monitoring
- Stage 1-2: Annual eGFR and UACR
- Stage 3: Every 6-12 months
- Stage 4-5: Every 3-6 months
- Nephrology referral for stage 4-5 or rapidly declining function

### Renal Replacement Therapy
Consider when eGFR <15 or symptoms of uremia:
- Hemodialysis
- Peritoneal dialysis
- Kidney transplantation
