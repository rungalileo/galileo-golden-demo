# Clinical Treatment Protocols and Guidelines

## Acute Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack) - Emergency Protocol

### Initial Assessment and Recognition
Time is muscle - rapid recognition and treatment is critical.

**Symptoms requiring immediate evaluation:**
- Chest pain or discomfort (pressure, squeezing, fullness)
- Pain radiating to jaw, shoulder, arm, or back
- Shortness of breath
- Nausea, vomiting, or indigestion-like symptoms
- Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness
- Cold sweats

**Risk stratification:**
- STEMI (ST-Elevation MI): ST elevation on EKG - requires immediate reperfusion
- NSTEMI (Non-ST-Elevation MI): Troponin elevation without ST elevation
- Unstable angina: No troponin elevation but concerning symptoms

### Immediate Management (First 10 Minutes)
1. Call 911 or activate emergency response
2. Position patient comfortably (usually sitting upright)
3. Obtain vital signs (BP, HR, RR, O2 sat)
4. Administer oxygen if O2 saturation <90%
5. 12-lead EKG within 10 minutes
6. Establish IV access
7. Continuous cardiac monitoring

### MONA-B Protocol
**M** - Morphine: 2-4 mg IV every 5-15 minutes for pain control (use cautiously)
**O** - Oxygen: 2-4 L/min nasal cannula if SpO2 <90%
**N** - Nitroglycerin: 0.4 mg sublingual every 5 minutes x3 (if SBP >90)
**A** - Aspirin: 162-325 mg chewed immediately (unless contraindicated)
**B** - Beta-blocker: Oral beta-blocker within 24 hours (if no contraindications)

### Antiplatelet Therapy
- Aspirin 162-325 mg loading dose (chewed for faster absorption)
- P2Y12 inhibitor loading:
  * Clopidogrel 600 mg oral (if going to cath lab)
  * Ticagrelor 180 mg oral (preferred in ACS)
  * Prasugrel 60 mg oral (if going for PCI, no history of stroke)

### Anticoagulation
Options include:
- Unfractionated heparin: 60 units/kg bolus (max 4000), then 12 units/kg/hr
- Enoxaparin: 1 mg/kg SC twice daily
- Fondaparinux: 2.5 mg SC daily

### Reperfusion Strategy for STEMI
**Door-to-balloon time goal: <90 minutes**

Primary PCI (preferred if available):
- Immediate cardiac catheterization
- Balloon angioplasty ± stent placement
- Preferred if symptom onset <12 hours

Fibrinolytic therapy (if PCI not available within 120 minutes):
- Administer within 30 minutes of hospital arrival
- Options: Alteplase, reteplase, tenecteplase
- Transfer to PCI-capable facility after thrombolysis

### Post-MI Management
- ICU or cardiac care unit admission
- Continuous telemetry monitoring
- Serial cardiac enzymes (troponin at 0, 3-6 hours)
- Echocardiogram to assess LV function
- Initiate guideline-directed medical therapy

### Secondary Prevention (Discharge Medications)
**Essential medications (unless contraindicated):**
- Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor) for at least 12 months
- High-intensity statin (Atorvastatin 80 mg daily)
- Beta-blocker (Metoprolol succinate or Carvedilol)
- ACE inhibitor or ARB (especially if EF <40%)
- Consider aldosterone antagonist if EF <35%

## Acute Stroke - Emergency Protocol

### Recognition: BE FAST Assessment
**B** - Balance: Sudden loss of balance or coordination
**E** - Eyes: Sudden vision changes
**F** - Face: Facial droop (ask patient to smile)
**A** - Arm: Arm weakness (ask patient to raise both arms)
**S** - Speech: Slurred speech (ask patient to repeat a phrase)
**T** - Time: Time to call 911 - note time of symptom onset

### Critical Time Windows
- IV thrombolysis (tPA): Within 4.5 hours of symptom onset
- Mechanical thrombectomy: Within 24 hours for select patients
- Every minute counts: 1.9 million neurons die per minute during stroke

### Initial Emergency Department Management
1. **Immediate assessment (<10 minutes):**
   - Vital signs
   - Fingerstick glucose
   - Brief neurological exam (NIH Stroke Scale)
   - Exact time of symptom onset (last known well time)
   - Activate stroke team

2. **Diagnostic workup (<25 minutes):**
   - Non-contrast head CT or MRI (rule out hemorrhage)
   - Labs: CBC, metabolic panel, PT/INR, troponin
   - EKG
   - Consider CT angiography if large vessel occlusion suspected

### IV Alteplase (tPA) Protocol
**Inclusion criteria:**
- Ischemic stroke with measurable neurological deficit
- Symptom onset <4.5 hours (or wake-up stroke with DWI-FLAIR mismatch)
- Age ≥18 years
- CT showing no hemorrhage

**Key exclusion criteria:**
- Hemorrhage on imaging
- Recent surgery (<14 days)
- Recent stroke or head trauma (<3 months)
- Active internal bleeding
- Platelets <100,000
- INR >1.7 or on novel anticoagulants
- Glucose <50 mg/dL
- Blood pressure >185/110 (must lower first)

**Dosing:**
- 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg)
- Give 10% as bolus over 1 minute
- Give remaining 90% as infusion over 60 minutes

### Mechanical Thrombectomy
For large vessel occlusion (LVO):
- Can be performed up to 24 hours in selected patients
- Best outcomes within 6 hours
- Requires comprehensive stroke center
- May be used alone or after IV tPA

### Blood Pressure Management in Acute Stroke
**For thrombolysis candidates:**
- Target BP <185/110 before tPA
- Maintain BP <180/105 for 24 hours after tPA

**For non-thrombolysis patients:**
- Permissive hypertension (allow BP up to 220/120)
- Only treat if BP >220/120 or evidence of end-organ damage

**Medications for acute BP lowering:**
- Labetalol 10-20 mg IV push
- Nicardipine 5 mg/hr IV infusion

### Post-Stroke Care
- Neurological checks every 15 minutes x2 hours, then hourly x6 hours
- NPO until swallow evaluation completed
- DVT prophylaxis with pneumatic compression devices
- Early mobilization when safe
- Physical/occupational/speech therapy evaluation

### Secondary Stroke Prevention
Based on stroke etiology:
- **Atherosclerotic:** Dual antiplatelet therapy x21 days, then single agent; high-intensity statin
- **Cardioembolic:** Anticoagulation (warfarin or DOAC) for atrial fibrillation
- **Small vessel:** Antiplatelet therapy; aggressive BP and glucose control
- **Cryptogenic:** Consider extended cardiac monitoring; may warrant anticoagulation

## Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) - Treatment Protocol

### Diagnosis (requires all three):
1. Blood glucose >250 mg/dL
2. pH <7.3 or bicarbonate <18 mEq/L
3. Ketonemia or ketonuria

### Severity Classification
- Mild: pH 7.25-7.3, bicarbonate 15-18
- Moderate: pH 7.0-7.24, bicarbonate 10-14
- Severe: pH <7.0, bicarbonate <10

### Initial Assessment and Stabilization
1. **ABCs and vital signs**
2. **Labs:**
   - Basic metabolic panel, anion gap
   - Venous or arterial blood gas
   - Beta-hydroxybutyrate (preferred over urine ketones)
   - Complete blood count
   - Consider blood cultures if infection suspected
   - Phosphate level

3. **Identify precipitating cause:**
   - Infection (most common)
   - Insulin omission
   - New-onset diabetes
   - MI, stroke, pancreatitis
   - Medications (steroids, SGLT2 inhibitors)

### Fluid Resuscitation
**Phase 1 - Initial bolus:**
- 1-2 liters normal saline (0.9%) over first 1-2 hours
- Goal: Restore intravascular volume

**Phase 2 - Maintenance (after initial bolus):**
- If corrected sodium normal or high: 0.45% saline at 250-500 mL/hr
- If corrected sodium low: 0.9% saline at 250-500 mL/hr
- When glucose <200 mg/dL: Add dextrose (D5W with NS)

**Total fluid requirement:**
- Typically 4-6 liters over first 24 hours
- Monitor for fluid overload (especially in elderly, renal disease, heart failure)

### Insulin Therapy
**Continuous IV regular insulin infusion:**
1. **Do NOT start insulin until potassium >3.3 mEq/L**
2. **Initial bolus:** 0.1 units/kg IV push (optional, may omit)
3. **Continuous infusion:** 0.1 units/kg/hour (typically 5-10 units/hour)

**Adjustment:**
- If glucose not decreasing by 50-75 mg/dL/hour: Increase insulin by 1 unit/hour
- When glucose reaches 200 mg/dL: Reduce insulin to 0.02-0.05 units/kg/hr AND add dextrose to fluids
- Goal: Glucose 150-200 mg/dL until DKA resolved

**Transition to subcutaneous insulin:**
- When anion gap normalized AND bicarbonate >15 AND pH >7.3
- Give subcutaneous insulin, then continue IV insulin for 1-2 hours overlap
- Prevents rebound hyperglycemia

### Potassium Replacement (Critical!)
Insulin drives potassium into cells, causing hypokalemia.

**Initial potassium <3.3 mEq/L:**
- HOLD insulin
- Give potassium 20-30 mEq/hr until K >3.3

**Potassium 3.3-5.2 mEq/L:**
- Add 20-30 mEq potassium to each liter of fluid

**Potassium >5.2 mEq/L:**
- Hold potassium replacement
- Check level every 2 hours

### Bicarbonate Therapy (Controversial)
Generally NOT recommended unless:
- pH <6.9
- Severe hyperkalemia
- Cardiac instability

If given: 100 mEq sodium bicarbonate in 400 mL water over 2 hours

### Phosphate Replacement
Not routinely given despite low levels.
Consider if:
- Serum phosphate <1.0 mg/dL
- Cardiac dysfunction
- Respiratory depression
- Hemolytic anemia

Dose: 20-30 mEq potassium phosphate added to fluids

### Monitoring
**Hourly:**
- Blood glucose (fingerstick)
- Vital signs
- Urine output

**Every 2-4 hours:**
- Basic metabolic panel
- Venous blood gas (pH, bicarbonate)
- Anion gap calculation

**Resolution criteria (all required):**
- Glucose <200 mg/dL
- Anion gap <12
- Bicarbonate >15 mEq/L
- Venous pH >7.3

### Common Pitfalls
1. Starting insulin before potassium is adequate (can cause fatal arrhythmia)
2. Stopping IV insulin too early (causes rebound DKA)
3. Inadequate fluid resuscitation
4. Too-rapid correction (risk of cerebral edema, especially in children)
5. Missing underlying precipitant (infection, MI)

## Anaphylaxis - Emergency Treatment Protocol

### Recognition
Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction requiring immediate treatment.

**Diagnostic criteria (requires any ONE of the following):**

1. **Acute onset involving skin/mucosa PLUS ONE:**
   - Respiratory compromise (wheeze, stridor, hypoxia)
   - Hypotension or end-organ dysfunction

2. **Two or more of these after likely allergen exposure:**
   - Skin/mucosal involvement
   - Respiratory compromise
   - Hypotension or syncope
   - Persistent GI symptoms

3. **Hypotension after exposure to known allergen:**
   - Adults: SBP <90 or >30% decrease from baseline
   - Children: Age-specific low BP or >30% decrease

### Common Triggers
- Foods (peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, eggs, milk)
- Medications (penicillin, NSAIDs, vaccines)
- Insect stings (bees, wasps, fire ants)
- Latex
- Exercise (food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis)
- Idiopathic (unknown trigger)

### Immediate Management

**Step 1: Epinephrine (First-Line Treatment)**
- **Intramuscular epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL)**
- **Dose:** 0.3-0.5 mg IM adults; 0.01 mg/kg IM children (max 0.3 mg)
- **Site:** Anterolateral thigh (vastus lateralis muscle)
- **Can repeat every 5-15 minutes as needed**
- **No absolute contraindications in anaphylaxis**

**Step 2: Patient positioning**
- Supine with legs elevated (if hypotensive)
- Sitting upright (if severe respiratory distress)
- Do NOT make patient stand or walk

**Step 3: Call for help**
- Activate emergency response (911)
- Request advanced airway equipment
- Prepare for potential cardiovascular collapse

**Step 4: Supplemental oxygen**
- High-flow oxygen 8-10 L/min via non-rebreather mask
- Target O2 saturation >95%

**Step 5: IV access and fluids**
- Establish large-bore IV access (2 lines if possible)
- Rapid fluid bolus: 1-2 liters normal saline (adults); 20 mL/kg (children)
- May need multiple liters if distributive shock

### Second-Line Medications

**H1 antihistamine (adjunct, not substitute for epinephrine):**
- Diphenhydramine 25-50 mg IV/IM/PO

**H2 antihistamine:**
- Ranitidine 50 mg IV or Famotidine 20 mg IV

**Corticosteroids (may prevent biphasic reaction):**
- Methylprednisolone 125 mg IV or
- Prednisone 40-60 mg PO
- Note: Onset of action 4-6 hours, so NOT helpful acutely

**Bronchodilators (if significant bronchospasm):**
- Albuterol 2.5-5 mg nebulized

### Refractory Anaphylaxis
If inadequate response to multiple doses of IM epinephrine:

**IV epinephrine infusion:**
- Mix 1 mg epinephrine in 1 L NS (1 mcg/mL concentration)
- Start at 0.1-0.5 mcg/min (6-30 mL/hr)
- Titrate to effect (max 10 mcg/min)
- Requires continuous cardiac monitoring

**Vasopressors:**
- Norepinephrine infusion if profound hypotension
- Dopamine 5-20 mcg/kg/min

**Glucagon (especially if patient on beta-blockers):**
- 1-2 mg IV/IM bolus
- Can repeat or give as infusion 5-15 mcg/min

### Airway Management
If airway compromise:
- Early intubation (before complete airway obstruction)
- Difficult airway anticipated (angioedema may make intubation extremely difficult)
- Consider cricothyrotomy if cannot intubate
- Have emergency airway equipment ready

### Observation Period
**All patients require observation:**
- Minimum 4-8 hours if good response to initial treatment
- 12-24 hours if severe reaction, required multiple doses epinephrine, or unknown allergen
- Risk of biphasic reaction (recurrence 4-12 hours later) in 5-20% of cases

### Discharge Planning
**Epinephrine auto-injector:**
- Prescribe 2 epinephrine auto-injectors (EpiPen, Auvi-Q)
- Train patient on proper use
- Emphasize carrying at all times

**Allergy action plan:**
- Written instructions on recognition and treatment
- When to use epinephrine (at first sign of reaction, don't wait)
- Call 911 after using epinephrine

**Allergen avoidance:**
- Identify and avoid trigger if known
- Medical alert bracelet
- Referral to allergist for further testing and immunotherapy consideration

**Medications to send home:**
- Prednisone 40-60 mg daily x3-5 days
- Antihistamine (cetirizine 10 mg daily x3-5 days)
- Emphasize: These are NOT substitutes for epinephrine

**Special considerations:**
- Patients on beta-blockers: Increased risk of refractory anaphylaxis
- Patients on ACE inhibitors: May have more severe reactions
- Asthma: Increased risk of severe respiratory compromise

### Prevention
- Strict avoidance of known allergen
- Pre-medication before contrast dye (if prior reaction)
- Drug desensitization protocols (if medication needed and no alternative)
- Venom immunotherapy (for insect sting allergy)

**De-escalate based on culture results - ALWAYS!**

### Fluid Resuscitation

**Initial bolus:**
- 30 mL/kg crystalloid within 3 hours
- 70 kg patient = 2,100 mL (approximately 2 liters)

**Type of fluid:**
- Balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's, Plasma-Lyte) preferred
- Normal saline acceptable
- Avoid starches (increased kidney injury, mortality)
- Albumin: Reserve for patients requiring large volumes

**Dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness:**

**Add epinephrine if still hypotensive:**
- Start 0.05 mcg/kg/min, titrate to effect

**Corticosteroids (if refractory shock):**
- Hydrocortisone 200 mg/day continuous infusion OR 50 mg IV q6h
- Only if requiring high-dose or multiple vasopressors

### Source Control
- Critical for successful treatment
- Remove infected devices (catheters, hardware)
- Drain abscesses
- Debride infected tissue
- Emergency surgery if indicated (perforated viscus, necrotizing fasciitis)
- **Timing:** Within 6-12 hours ideally

### Supportive Care

**Glucose control:**
- Target glucose <180 mg/dL
- Use insulin infusion if needed

**Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis:**
- Pharmacologic: Enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily OR unfractionated heparin 5000 units SC q8-12h
- Mechanical: Sequential compression devices if contraindication to anticoagulation

**Stress ulcer prophylaxis:**
- Only if risk factors (mechanical ventilation, coagulopathy)
- PPI (omeprazole 40 mg daily) or H2 blocker

**Nutrition:**
- Early enteral nutrition within 24-48 hours (if tolerating)
- Preferred over parenteral nutrition

**Blood products:**
- Transfuse RBC if hemoglobin <7 g/dL
- Platelets if <10,000 OR <50,000 with active bleeding
- Fresh frozen plasma only if active bleeding and coagulopathy

### Monitoring
**Continuous:**

### Common Complications
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- Acute kidney injury (may require renal replacement therapy)
- Liver dysfunction
- Coagulopathy/DIC
- ICU-acquired weakness
- Delirium

### Prognosis
- Mortality: ~10-20% for sepsis, 30-40% for septic shock
- Early recognition and treatment improves outcomes
- Each hour delay in antibiotics increases mortality 7-8%
