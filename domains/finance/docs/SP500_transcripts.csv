0,Costco,Q1,"Richard A. Galanti
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Costco Wholesale
Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.
The comparable sales and comparable sales, excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP.
In today's release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '24 for the 12 weeks ended November 26th. Reported net income for the 12-week first quarter came in at $1.509 billion or $3.58 per share from a $1.364 billion or $3.7 per share in the 12-week first quarter last year. This year's results included a tax benefit of $44 million or $0.10 a share related to stock-based compensation. Last year's results included a tax benefit of $53 million or $0.12 per share. Related to stock-based compensation and also included a charge of $93 million pre-tax or $0.15 per share, primarily related to downsizing our charter shipping activities.
Net sales for the first quarter were $56.72 billion, a 6.1% increase over last year's first quarter 53.44 billion. Net sales were benefited by approximately 1.5% to 1% in the US and worldwide from the shift to the fiscal calendar as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023.
The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail weeks. In the US, reported 2% comp sales ex-gas deflation and FX, 2.6%, Canada reported 6.4%, ex-gas, and FX, 8.2% other International reported 11.2% ex-gas and FX, 7.1%. For total company reported 3.8% and 3.9%, excluding those two items. E-commerce, which was reported on us as 6.3%, came in at 6.1% excluding FX.
Overall, for the first fiscal quarter. Fresh foods were relatively strong, once again with food and sundries right behind. Non-foods showed improvement over the September-October-November timeframe as did comp sales. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics traffic or shopping frequency increased 4.7% worldwide and 3.6% in the United States. Our average transaction was down nine-tenths of a percent worldwide, and down 1.6% in the US. Foreign currencies relative to the US dollar positively impacted sales by approximately four-tenths of a percent while gasoline price deflation, negatively impacted sales by approximately six-tenths of a percent.
I've got more than a few calls in the past few weeks as to how many we sold up in the US, leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday. In the US in the three days leading up to Thanksgiving, we sold $2.9 million of our famous Pumpkin pies along with $1.3 million of Apple pies and corn pies. So over four million pies in total during the three days.
Back to the income statement here. Next on the income statement is membership fee income. In the quarter, we reported a 1.082 billion or 1.91%, that's an $82 million or 8.2% increase, and a four basis-point increase over the first quarter last year. In terms of renewal rates at the first quarter end, our US and Canada renewal rate stood at 92.8%, while the worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, both of these rates were up one-tenth of 1% from those numbers by 12 weeks earlier at the end of the fourth quarter.
Membership growth continues, we ended Q1 with 72.0 million paid household members up 7.6% versus last year, and 129.5 million cardholders up 7.1% with consistent growth throughout the quarters. At Q1 end, we had 33.2 million paid executive members, an increase of 939,000 during the 12-week since Q4 end. Executive members now represent a little over 46% of our paid members, and a little over 73% of worldwide sales.
Moving down the income statement next is our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by 40 basis points coming in at 11.04%, up from Q1 of last year at 10.61%, that 43 basis points reported number ex-gas deflation would be plus 36 basis points. As I normally do here we write down two columns and six line items. The first column is reported in the first quarter. The second column is margins excluding gas deflation. It's the year-over-year change. In the first quarter. On a core merchandise plus three basis-points reported minus three basis-points ex-deflation. Ancillary and other businesses plus 24% reported and plus 22% ex-deflation gas deflation, 2% reward lower year-over-year minus four basis points reported and minus three basis points ex-gas deflation. LIFO plus three basis points and plus three basis points and other plus 17 basis points, plus 17 basis points for a total again reported year-over-year, up 43 basis points and ex-gas deflation, up 36 basis points.
Starting with the core. Again, it was a total company, it was plus three basis points and minus three basis points reported in ex-gas deflation. In terms of core margin on their own sales or core on core margins were up by five basis points year-over-year. Ancillary and other business gross margin again, higher by 24 basis points and higher by 22 basis points, ex deflation, gas deflation. This increase was driven largely by gas and e-com. Our 2% reward higher by four basis points and higher by three basis points ex-gas deflation reflecting higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO plus three basis points. We had a $15 million LIFO credit in the first quarter of this year. This compared to a very small $0.5 million LIFO charge in Q1 a year ago.
And then the other line item, 17 basis points to the positive, as was mentioned earlier, last year in Q1, there was a 17 basis point impact from a 93 million pretax charge primarily related -- primarily for the downsizing of our charter shipping activities.
Moving onto SG&A. We reported SG&A of 9.45%, higher by 25 basis points than last year's 9.20%. Again in Q1, right down the two columns reported without gas deflation operations minus 18 basis points and minus 14 basis points minus being, meaning it's higher year-over-year, central minus two basis points and minus one basis point; stock compensation minus three basis points and minus two basis points; preopening expense, minus two basis points and minus two basis points. Again, for a total reported margin higher minus 25 basis points year-over-year. Yes. I'm sorry SG&A net margin 25 basis points and without gas deflation higher by 19 basis points.
The core again was higher by 18 basis points and higher by 14 basis points excluding the impact from gas. This included a 12 weeks of this past March as extra top-of-scale increase in our wages, which represents an estimated two basis-point hit. And as of September 18th, we raised our starting wage in the US and Canada. That estimated impact from those new wages to be roughly two basis points as well. Again, central, nothing much to say other than it's one basis point by higher excluding gas deflation. Again, it was stock comps at the minus two basis points ex-gas deflation at preopening. We did have a couple of more openings this year in the quarter than we did last year and that was higher by two basis points.
Below the operating income line, interest expense was 38 basis points -- $38 million this year, $4 million higher than last year's $34 million per year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $107 million coming in at $160 million this year versus $53 million last year. This was driven largely by the increase in interest income, about $100 million of about $107 million due to higher interest rates as well as higher cash balances. The small additional impact was a favorable FX year-over-year.
In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter was 24.5%. This compares to 23.0% a year ago or 1.5 percentage points higher this year than last year. The increase in our rate as of Q1 -- in Q1 is primarily attributable to lower benefit from the stock-based compensation from a year ago. Overall, reported net income was up 16.5% year-over-year in the quarter.
A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion in the first quarter, we opened 10 locations, including one relos. So net of nine increases. Those nine included eight in the US and one in Canada. For the full year of fiscal '24, we estimate opening, we're planning to open 33 locations, including two relos. So, for a net increase of 31 new warehouses that would be up from 23 that we opened in fiscal '23. For Q2 fiscal '24, we plan four new locations, including our six building in China early in the calendar year.
Regarding capital expenditures. First quarter capital expenditure spend was approximately 1.04 billion. We estimate that fiscal '24 capex will be in the $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion range. That's up from $4.3 billion we had in fiscal '23, reflecting a continued increase in the number of the expansion that we're doing. In terms of e-commerce business. E-com sales in Q1, ex-FX increased 6.1%. The first quarterly year-over-year increase in five fiscal quarters have trended well during the three reporting periods of September, October, November. E-com showed strength in several areas. In food, things like e-gift cards, pet items, snack items were up in the mid-teens. Appliances were up year-over-year in the mid-20s, TVs was actually in the high singles despite the challenges with other aspects of consumer electronics like computers and tires were up in the low teens. So overall, a pretty good showing there.
As well, Costco Logistics enjoyed record-breaking deliveries. In the first quarter of fiscal '24, we completed over 800,000 deliveries, which were up 17% versus the comparable quarter last year. And some fun wild items in the quarter in e-commerce. You've probably read about the fact that we're solving one-ounce gold buyers. We sold over $100 million of gold during the quarter, we sold a Baybrook autographed index for $20,000. And in addition to E-gift cards on everything from restaurants to golf to airlines, and we just in the last couple of weeks, we launched a Disney eGift Card valued at $250 for $224.99. And for you, last-minute shoppers out there, there is a Mickey Mantle autographed 1951 rookie card in nearly perfect condition and it's on sale online for $250,000.
Next, good progress continues to be made with our e-com mobile and digital efforts. No big enhancements and changes to the site, leading up to the holidays, mostly holiday prep. We did have 100%, I would say availability during Cyber Week, and sales for the Five Cyber Days Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Cyber Monday were up year-over-year in the mid-teens. Our app downloads during the quarter were 234 million. So total app downloads now stand at 30.5 million or a 10% increase during the quarter and that's after a be over 40% increase in all of fiscal '23 versus the prior year. Our site traffic approaching 0.5 billion and just under 10% increase in the average order value being up about 2.5%, so continue to make progress there.
Next, a couple of comments regarding inflation, most recently in the last fourth quarter discussion we had estimated that year-over-year inflation was in the 1% to 2% range. Our estimate for the quarter just ended, that inflation was in the zero to 1% range. Bigger deflation in some big and bulky items like furniture sets due to lower freight costs year-over-year, as well as on things like domestic bulky lower-priced items. Again, where the freight cost is significant, some deflationary items were as much as 20% to 30% and again mostly freight-related. TVs, the average sale prices have been lower, while units have been higher. And in talking to the buyers overall, our inventories are SKU counts are in good shape across all channels. And so far, we've had a good seasonal sell-through during the quarter.
Lastly, as you saw in this afternoon's press release, we declared a $15 per share special cash dividend. This is our fifth special dividend in 11 years. The total payout will be about just under $6.7 billion and will be funded using existing cash and that's accompanied by any issuance of debt. The special cash dividend would paid on January 12 to shareholders of record on December 28th.
Finally, in terms of upcoming releases. We will announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, December 31st on Thursday, January 4th, after market close.
With that, I will turn it back for Q&A to Lisa, and be happy to answer any questions."

Chair & Chief Executive Officer at Adobe
Thanks, Jonathan. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us.
Q4 was our first-ever $5 billion quarter, a new record for the company. Adobe achieved revenue of $5.05 billion, representing 13% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $3.23 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.27, representing 28% and 19% year-over-year growth, respectively. Q4 was the culmination of another record year for Adobe, achieving $19.41 billion in revenue, which represents 13% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2023 was $11.82 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $16.07, both representing 17% year-over-year growth. We exited the year with $17.22 billion in RPO.
Our strong performance reflects the mission-critical role our products play in a digital-first world, incredible product innovation and exceptional execution. Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud have become the foundation of digital experiences, starting with the moment of inspiration to the creation and development of content and media to the personalized delivery and activation across every channel. Adobe's mission of changing the world through personalized digital experiences and our delivery of foundational technology platforms, set us up for the next decade of growth. We take pride in being one of the most inventive, diversified, and profitable software companies in the world. We believe that every massive technology shift offers generational opportunities to deliver new products and solutions to an ever-expanding set of customers.
AI and generative AI is one such opportunity and we've articulated, how we intend to invest and differentiate across, data, models, and interfaces. We have delivered against this strategy and I'm pleased that a number of our groundbreaking innovations, including our Firefly models and integrations across Creative Cloud, Liquid mode and integrations across Document Cloud and AI services in our real-time Customer Data Platform and integrations in Experience Cloud, are now seeing tremendous usage by customers. We remain excited about the strategic opportunity with Figma, to jointly advance product design, accelerate collaborative creativity on the web, and redefine the future of creativity and productivity.
We continue to engage with the European Commission, the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK, and the US Department of Justice, as they conduct their regulatory reviews. The EC has provided a preliminary statement of objections and the CMA has issued provisional findings of competition concerns. We strongly disagree with these findings and are responding to the respective regulators. As per the current time lines, the EC's decision deadline is February 5th and the CMAs is February 25th, while the DOJ does not have a formal time line to decide whether to bring a complaint, we expect a decision soon.
I'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our Digital Media business.

David Wadhwani
President, Digital Media Business at Adobe
Thanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone.
In Q4, we achieved net new Digital Media ARR of $569 million and revenue of $3.72 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year, fueled by innovation in both our Creative and Document businesses. Starting with Creative Cloud, global demand for content is accelerating and continues to be a tailwind for the business. Creative Cloud remains the creativity platform of choice for creators across imaging photography, design, video, web, animation, and 3D. Our rapid pace of product and AI model innovation is empowering a wide and growing base of individuals, students, creative professionals, small-business owners, and enterprises to create and monetize amazing content more quickly and easily than ever before.
We were thrilled to come together in person with thousands of creators at Adobe MAX in Los Angeles. And at our MAX event in Tokyo with millions more from our community engaging with us online. We reached a record 300 million social interactions in the month following MAX. Q4 was a record quarter for Creative Cloud, achieving $3 billion in revenue, which grew 14% year-over-year. Net new Creative Cloud ARR was $398 million. Business highlights include strong digital traffic, resulting from product innovation, social engagement, and our continued product-led growth efforts which drove record new commercial subscriptions in the quarter.
The general availability of our generative AI Firefly models and their integrations across Creative Cloud growth, tremendous customer excitement with over 4.5 billion generations since launch in March. The release of three new Firefly models, Firefly Image two model, Firefly Vector model, and Firefly Design model, offering highly differentiated levels of control with FX, photos settings, and Generative Match. We also introduced generative credits as part of our Creative Cloud subscription plans. The general availability of Photoshop Generative Fill and Generative Expand which are seeing record adoption, they're already among the most used features in the product.
Advances in Adobe Illustrator with the introduction of Text Vector beta enabling users to generate icons, scenes, subjects, patterns, ingredients. Adobe Premiere Pro advances include a significant performance improvement in the time line for faster and smoother editing, new color preferences, and improved tone mapping. Premiere Pro is now natively integrated with frame.io offering faster, content sharing and collaboration. The combination of Adobe Express and Firefly is enabling everyone from Creative Pros to beginners to quickly move from ideation to task-based workflows and Express dramatically expanding our reach and widening our top-of-funnel.
The family of generative capabilities across Express including Text to Image, Text to Effects, Text to Template, and Generative Fill are driving adoption of Express and making it even faster and more fun for users of all skill levels. Express now comes pre-installed on all new Chromebooks, making it accessible to students, educators, and anyone using Chrome OS. Continued strength in Adobe Stock which had its best year ever driven by accelerating demand for high-quality image, vector, video, and 3D content. Creative Cloud, Express, and Firefly integrations with Adobe GenStudio enabling ideation, creation, and stakeholder collaboration as part of their overall content supply chain, strong mid-market and enterprise adoption driven by up-sell to Creative Cloud offerings with Firefly.
Key customer wins include Cyber Agent, Deloitte, Discovery Communications, Nexstar Media, Pepsi, Publicis, and the United Nations. We are thrilled with the momentum we're seeing in the Creative business following a year of unprecedented innovation. Customer excitement around Firefly integrations across our applications has been great to see with community engagement, social interactions, and creative marketing campaigns, driving organic brand search volume, traffic, and record demand. While we started rolling out new Creative Cloud pricing in select geographies in November, the primary driver of growth continues to be new paid subscriptions across our routes-to-market. We are excited to build on this momentum as we enter FY '24.
Now turning to Document Cloud, digital documents are essential enablers of our personal and professional lives. Document Cloud is a leader in digital documents powering all common document actions including editing, sharing, reviewing, scanning, and signing. Document Cloud innovations are advancing accessibility, comprehension, productivity, automation, and security in document workflows across web, desktop, and mobile. In Q4, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $721 million, growing 17% year-over-year. We added a record $171 million of net new Document Cloud ARR with ending ARR, growing 23% year-over-year in constant currency.
Business highlights include; Acrobat web growth, which continues to be an incredible source of customer acquisition, with monthly active users up over 70% year-over-year. The surge in usage of link sharing for stakeholder collaboration around PDF files, which increased 400% year-over-year, creating a viral growth loop, that is bringing 10s of millions of users into the Acrobat ecosystem. This is a great example of how we are scaling our PLG motions. Strong demand for Acrobat on mobile with MAU surpassing 100 million users in Q4. Liquid Mode has now served over one billion files to customers demonstrating how indispensable this technology has become on mobile devices. Adobe Acrobat to Express workflows making it even easier to import, edit, and enhance documents to create visually stunning PDFs. Key enterprise customer wins include Alshaya, Bank of America, Department of Veterans Affairs, MasterCard, State Farm Auto Insurance, and Volkswagen.
Much like the Creative business, we expect generative AI to deliver additional value and attract new customers to Document Cloud, Acrobat's generative AI capabilities, which will enable new creation comprehension and collaboration functionality have already been rolled out in a private beta. We expect to release this in a public beta in the coming months. It's been an extraordinary year for the Digital Media business with the introduction of hundreds of transformative innovations that are reshaping the future of creativity, productivity, and digital experiences. Capping this year as many accolades, TIME magazine recognized Adobe Liquid Mode, Photoshop Generative Fill, and Generative Expand, among the best inventions of 2023.
I'll now pass it to Anil.

Anil Chakravarthy
President, Digital Experience Business at Adobe
Thanks, David. Hello, everyone.
Digital experiences are indispensable for every business in every category, enabling companies of all sizes to engage and transact with customers around the world. Adobe's Holiday Shopping Report, which analyzes trillions of data points, found that both Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales hit record highs of $9.8 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively, jumping 7.5% and 9.6% from last year. We predicted that holiday 2023 spend will exceed $221 billion in the US alone. Adobe Experience Cloud is optimally positioned to capitalize on this massive global opportunity. Companies across B2C and B2B are turning to Adobe Experience Cloud as the platform to accelerate experience-led growth.

Generative AI accelerates our pace of innovation across the Experience Cloud portfolio enabling us to build on our capabilities to deliver personalized digital experiences.
Our efforts are focused in three areas: one, augmenting our applications with an AI Assistant that significantly enhances productivity for current users, and provides an intuitive conversational interface to enable many more knowledge workers to use our products. Two; reimagining existing Experience Cloud applications, like we did with Adobe Experience Manager; and three, developing entirely new solutions built for the age of generative AI, like Adobe GenStudio. In Q4, we continue to drive strong growth in the Experience Cloud business across our enterprise and mid-market customers achieving $1.27 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $1.12 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth.
Business highlights include, strong momentum with Adobe Experience Platform and native applications inclusive of Real-Time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer, and Customer Journey Analytics. AEP had its first $100 million quarter of net-new business in Q4 and exited the year with a greater than $700 million annualized book of business. Release of Adobe GenStudio, an end-to-end solution that brings together best-in-class applications across Creative Cloud, Express, and Experience Cloud with Firefly generative AI at the core to help brands meet the rising demand for content. GenStudio provides a comprehensive offering spanning content ideation, creation, production, and activation. We're seeing tremendous interest in GenStudio from brands like Henkel, Pepsi, and Verizon and agencies like Publicis, Omnicom, and Havas as they look to accelerate and optimize their content supply chains.
Reimagined customer experiences with the all-new Adobe Experience Manager Sites that enable businesses and developers to quickly test and optimize web content, deliver fastest possible page load times, and maximize SEO rankings, lighthouse scores, and conversion. Adobe was recognized as a leader in over 25 industry analyst reports this year, including the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms, B2B marketing automation platforms, and multichannel marketing hubs. In the Forrester Wave for Digital Experience Platforms which was published last week, Adobe received the highest scores for strategy.
Key customer wins include Alshaya, Coca-Cola, EY, IBM, Marriott, Riyadh Air, Santander Brasil, Sony, Southern Graphics, Unilever, Vanguard, and Verizon. In our conversations with these and other customers around the world, c-Level executives are continuing to prioritize experience-led growth as a critical business imperative, despite ongoing budget scrutiny. Adobe Experience Cloud is well-positioned to keep winning with innovative products that power end-to-end customer experiences and enable companies to simultaneously drive growth and profitability. We are looking forward to continuing our leadership and momentum into 2024.
I'll now pass it to Dan.

We drove world-class operating margins in Q4 and throughout fiscal 2023 by making disciplined investments in R&D marketing and sales and we're pleased that we grew EPS faster than revenue. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q4 was 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis in line with our expectations. RPO exiting the quarter was $17.22 billion, growing 13% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was $7.84 billion and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.6 billion, after making a previously discussed payment in the quarter of $826 million of US Federal taxes that we deferred from the second and third quarters of FY '23.
In Q4, we entered into a $1 billion share repurchase agreement and we currently have $2.15 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020. As a reminder, we measure ARR on a constant-currency basis during the fiscal year and revalue ARR at year-end. FX rate changes between December of 2022 and this year have resulted in a $160 million increase to Digital Media ARR balance entering FY '24, which is now $15.33 billion and is reflected in our updated investor datasheet. Factoring in the momentum across our businesses and current expectations for the macroeconomic and foreign-exchange environments, for FY '24, we are targeting total Adobe revenue of $21.30 billion to $21.50 billion. Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $1.9 billion, Digital Media segment revenue of $15.75 billion to $15.85 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $5.275 to $5.375 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $4.75 billion to $4.80 billion.
Tax rate of approximately 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP earnings per share of $13.45 to $13.85. And non-GAAP earnings per share of $17.60 to $18. As a reminder, and as is customary, these targets do not reflect our planned acquisition of Figma. We expect normal seasonality throughout the year with a seasonal step-down for new business into the first quarter, sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, typical Q3 summer seasonality, and a strong finish to the year in Q4. We expect our cash tax rate to improve sequentially in FY '24 by 2 percentage points as the amortization of previously capitalized R&D increases our deductions next year for tax purposes, benefiting our operating cash flows next year.
For Q1 FY '24, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $5.10 billion to $5.15 billion, Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $410 million, Digital Media segment revenue was $3.77 billion to 3.80 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.27 billion to $1.29 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion. Tax rate of approximately 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.40. And non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.40. While the implied operating margin for Q1 is up sequentially, we expect a typical seasonal margin step-down starting in Q2 as a result of the annual merit increases and disciplined investments to drive growth.
In summary, I couldn't be prouder of the company's performance in FY '23 and the momentum we're carrying into 2024 across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. Our strategy, scale, speed of execution, and profitability position us for years of sustained success.
Shantanu, back to you.

Shantanu Narayen
Chair & Chief Executive Officer at Adobe
Thanks Dan.
In addition to our financial accomplishments, we are proud to once again be recognized for our industry leadership. Content credentials and Adobe's approach to responsible AI were recognized by Fast Company as one of the year's breakthrough innovations. We were again named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, Glassdoor listed Adobe is one of the best places to work and Interbrand ranked us in the top 20 Best Global Brands as the rising brand for the eighth year in a row.
Digital remains a massive tailwind as content demand and consumption continues to grow and businesses of all sizes are focused on transforming their customer experiences. Adobe is incredibly well-positioned to lead and capitalize on this opportunity. Thanks to our innovative road map expanding global customer base, strong brand, and the best employees in the world. Our fiscal '24 financial targets reflect our confidence in continuing to drive strong top line growth and world-class profitability. I am more certain than ever that Adobe's best days are ahead of us.
Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator."
2,Oracle,Q2,"Safra Catz
Chief Executive Officer at Oracle
Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another great quarter. When you look at the top of our financial results table, a few things are very clear. The largest number, cloud services and license support is now 74% of the revenue, and it's recurring revenue, and it's the one growing by $1 billion this quarter. The smaller numbers, which are not recurring, now account for only 26%. This is exactly what we told you would happen and it's happening. And if this continues, total revenue growth will accelerate every year.
To that point, OCI is now one of the clear drivers of our acceleration. Imagine just three years ago, OCI was rarely if ever mentioned as a viable hyperscale alternative. Of course, we knew what we had built and we keep talking about it, and we knew it was only a matter of time. And now more industry analysts are catching on to what customers are choosing. For example, just last week, we were recognized as a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services.
Our financial results reflect the customers have figured out that by moving to OCI, they really can get more while paying less. On top of that, we are now the default choice for AI workloads, given our unique differentiation in price performance capabilities. Why specifically are they coming to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure? Well, it's a combination of several things.
Creating the second generation cloud enabled us to build a much better, more scalable, and more efficient cloud. We understood the limitations of the first generation and engineered very differently.
Second, we know what it takes to run at enterprise, scale, performance and security better than I'd say anyone else. Our 45-year history as the leading enterprise software company gives us unique knowledge of what exactly is required to run mission critical systems.
Third, we've recognized the customers' need deployment flexibility rather than just offer public cloud services like our competitors. We are the only vendor, which also offers dedicated clouded customer, dedicated regions, sovereign clouds, and Alloy, our partner clouds. And then finally, our belief in the importance of multi cloud offerings will be industry changing and these collaborations rollout. With all this success and exploding demand, we are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity build out.
Now to the Q2 results, with total revenue at the midpoint of my constant currency guidance and EPS at the high end of guidance. Now, as a reminder, currency was 1 point less helpful than when we gave guidance three months ago. Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS plus IaaS, excluding Cerner was $4.1 billion, up 25%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $4.8 billion, with IaaS revenue at $1.6 billion, up 50%, and SaaS revenue of $3.2 billion, up 14%.
Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 11%, driven again by our strategic cloud application, autonomous database and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes support were $4.5 billion, up 9%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $7.1 billion and were up 19%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support were $5.2 billion, up 12%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 50%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen2 infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 55% with an annualized revenue of $6 billion.
OCI consumption revenue was up 71%. Database subscription revenues, which includes database license support were up 4%, highlighted by Exadata Database Cloud services revenue, which was up 40% and Autonomous Database up 26%. Very importantly as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth, alongside strategic SaaS and Gen2 OCI.
Software license revenues were $1.2 billion, down 19% in a tough comparison to last year where it was up 23%. So all-in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.9 billion, up 4% including Cerner, actually up 6% excluding Cerner."
3,Salesforce,Q1,"Marc Benioff
Chief Executive Officer at Salesforce
All right. Hey Mike, thanks so much, and thanks for all your hard work. This year, it's been an incredible year. And also, I just really appreciate everyone being here on the call today, and hope you all had a great Thanksgiving, and I hope you're all preparing a fantastic holiday for yourself coming up. I know it's been an incredible year for so many of the folks on this call, and I'd just encourage all of my folks to try to take a couple of days off and do a little digital detox. And I hope you get a chance to do that as well as we come into the season.
We're obviously super excited about these results. We've delivered in this unbelievable quarter and in this unbelievable year, and this double-digit revenue growth, delivering non-GAAP margin exceeding 30%, this is really exciting for us. And when we look at these numbers, when we think about having an $8.7 billion quarter, 31.2% margin in the quarter, and then talking about this year at $34.8 billion fiscal year '24, amazing with 30.5% margin growth, whether it's 800%, 900%, 1,000% increase from year-over-year, these numbers all exceed what we thought we were able to do.
And I'll tell you, we really did this in partnership with all of you. I'm just going to come back to that a couple of times to give you the gratitude and thanks that you deserve for everything you've been doing to help us have an unbelievably great year.
But I'll tell you, it's more than just a great year. It's also a huge year of transformation. I think everyone on the call knows that. It was exactly a year ago, as you remember, or maybe I'd like to forget, exactly how crazy that year got, and it was a really unusual year. But we knew we had to change. We knew there had to be transformation. We knew there were things that had to get done, and we know, look, that we were going to have to restructure our business for the short and long term. We talked about that in each of the last several calls.
We knew we had to focus on increasing profitability, productivity, operational excellence across the board. We knew that. We knew that we had to really double down on our core, deliver some strong relationships with you, our investors. And then I'll just keep coming back to that, that you've been just such great partners in making all of this happen. And I'll tell you that we have to stay focused on continuing to be this #1 AI CRM, which we've been doing. You're going to hear about that today, and really finding these incredible growth factors for the company.
You know what, people have been asking me, why am I so excited about this quarter. And Brian is going to hit on this as well, and Amy is going to hit on this as well. The three things that keep coming back to me are -- number one, that we have 80% growth in deals of more than $1 million. That is far exceeding our expectations, that we were able to pull together all of these different clouds into this kind of what we call a cocktail. The customers were wanting to buy Tableau, Slack, MuleSoft, the Data Cloud, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, all that we're able to build these big transactions. And there's no question that that kind of fell off last year, now to see that come back, that is just really exciting. Brian's going to talk about that.
Number two -- we have a great new product, and everyone knows here at Dreamforce, Data Cloud. You can see in the quarter 1,000 new Data Cloud customers. That is number two thing. I am really excited about that. I literally just got off the plane from Tokyo. You probably all saw me yesterday at Salesforce World Tour. Tokyo was incredible. Everyone is very excited about Salesforce in Japan, now the second largest software company in Japan. Incredible what has happened over there in the market.
I met with hundreds of customers while I was there. I spoke to some of the CEOs of the largest companies in Japan. It was an incredible week. It was the Momiji season, which is the fall season with incredible fall leaves, beautiful over there. And I'll tell you, everyone wants to talk about Data Cloud. And that is really exciting to have an incredible driver for future growth. And the third thing is these Einstein GPT Copilots that we've delivered. These Einstein GPT Copilots, this is a product we didn't really even have an imagination around a year ago. Of course, we had Einstein. Of course, we could see the incredible growth of Einstein. I mean, now, Einstein, with predictive and generative combined, is doing 1 trillion transactions a week, that's amazing. But more amazing is that 17% of the Fortune 100 are now Einstein GPT Copilot customers. And this is a product that is just coming to market. Everyone is so excited about buying this product.
So, when you see these larger deals, when you see Data Cloud, when you see these Einstein GPT Copilots going into place, that is why we are excited about our growth and why we're excited about this quarter. And then you look at the financial metrics, the $1.5 billion in cash flow up about 1,000%. That is another reason why we're excited about the quarter.
So, let me get into the script a little bit, and let me talk to kind of give you the structured messages and then turn this over to Brian. So, number one, we are the #1 AI CRM. If that isn't clear already, we're leading the industry through the unprecedented AI innovation cycle. It's unlike anything I've seen and most of the people that I talk to all over the world feel the same way. We're the only platform that are bringing CRM and data and AI and trust together for our customers in a way that enables them across every industry to be more successful faster, be more productive, more efficient. We're the number one by market share for the 10th year in a row based on latest IDC software tracker. We're the number one enterprise apps company now. That's amazing.
And Data Cloud, this hyperscale, this real-time customer data platform that is performing incredibly well for us, it's the foundation of every AI transaction, but it's the foundation of every large deal that we did this quarter. That is what is so exciting. And in just our third quarter, Data Cloud has ingested an astonishing 6.4 trillion records -- 6.4 trillion records, that's 140% year-over-year increase. It triggered 1.4 trillion activations, a 220% increase year over year. This is a monster product. I could not be more excited. And it's the perfect time, we didn't really understand that it was going to line up so well with this generative AI revolution.
This is a product we've been working on for a couple of years, just the timing of it has been incredible because, listen, if you don't have your data together as in a company, you're not going to deliver AI. It's not like companies are going to run their AI off of Reddit or off of some kind of big public data set. They have to have their data set together to make AI work for them, and that is why the Data Cloud is so powerful for them.
Now, as I've said before, this AI revolution is going to be a trust revolution. It's not just about CRM data, or AI. It's also about trust, and I think the trust layer and the way that we've architected our platform so that our customers are not basically taking -- getting taken advantage of these next-generation large language models, these foundation models, they are so hungry for all of this data, and they want our customers' data, so that they can grow. We're not going to let them have it. We're going to separate ourselves from those models through a trust layer so customers can be protected. This is going to be so important for the future of how Salesforce architects itself with artificial intelligence.
Now, revenue in the quarter was $8.7 billion. Not too many software executives get to say it, so I think I'll say it twice actually. Revenue for the quarter was $8.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Incredible. Third largest enterprise software company now by revenue, also incredible, and companies standardizing on Salesforce as their core technology platform, doing these multi-cloud deals with us. Getting that growth, as I said, that incredible stat that Brian is going to come back to, the 80% growth in deals of more than $1 million, so exciting. Nine of the top 10 deals included six or more clouds. Think about that -- nine out of our top 10 deals included six or more clouds. So, you know that we have amazing clouds, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Platform, our Commerce Cloud, Slack, Tableau, MuleSoft, but think about it, how they're bringing all of those things together, Data Cloud, they're bringing it all together into a cocktail. That's amazing.
And by the way, those cocktails are going to be a Christmas cocktail soon. And in Q3, we once again showed our commitment to increasing our margins. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 31.2%, up 850 basis points year over year, following an increase of 1,000 basis points in the previous two quarters. It kind of is a sentence that you don't really expect ever read as a CEO, so that was kind of amazing.
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $1.5 billion, up 389% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 1,088% year-over-year. Percentages and absolute numbers are just mind blowing, and our remaining performance obligation ended the third quarter at $48.3 billion, which is an increase of -- oh, yes, 21% year-over-year, pretty good.
Okay, now, let's move on to guidance. Based on our performance, we're raising our fiscal year '24 revenue guidance in constant currency to $34.8 billion at the high end of the range, 11% projected growth year-over-year. Last quarter, we raised our fiscal year '24 non-GAAP operating margin to 30%, and now we're accelerating again. And we think that we're going to move this thing to 30.5% for the year. And Amy, I think you better beat that, okay? So, I mean, the acceleration on the margin this year has been pretty incredible as we all know. So, if you go back and look at the last five quarters, you wouldn't believe it. I don't believe it. We delivered an improvement of 850 basis points year-over-year this quarter. I couldn't be more proud of our entire team, how well they are doing.
We just got our employee surveys back. The team, the morale is super high, so cohesive, brought back so many boomerangs, really reinforced our culture during this year as well. That's been one of the major things that we have been doing. We've really been focused on building this #1 AI CRM, rebuilding our product strategy, really focused on -- number two, is getting these sales executives be able to tell these stories of AI success. And it's incredible to be able to exactly explain to a customer what they can do to be successful.
The third thing we're really focused on is this idea of delivering new products and new technologies and this UE+ product that we've now introduced in the market to see so many customers adopt that in the quarter, to see so much of it in our pipeline, UE+, and the incredible work of David Schmaier and his team has been just amazing there, and also our professional services team, delivering these great implementations and making sure our customers are successful. And the fifth thing I would say we're focused on is this Ohana 2.0 culture, which has really taken shape in the middle of this year and really now evidenced in this -- you probably saw we just became a Great Place to Work again. We're on the top 10. We're now number seven. It's amazing to see that recognition for this company is so well deserved.
So, where are we? Well, you're seeing this high level of interest in Data Cloud and Einstein. It's incredible what's happened. I've been on the road pretty much nonstop, especially over the last month. I've been in -- throughout Europe. I've been now in Asia. I've been throughout the United States, and I just continue to see these same trends, which is customers are investing for the future and they're investing and inspired by AI to give them more productivity. Look, they realize unemployment is just so low. Where are they going to hire more people? It's so hard for them to hire. They're going to have to get more productivity from their employees. They're going to do that through this great new technology, and we're going to help them make that happen.
Data Cloud was part of six of our top 10 deals in the quarter. We had more than 1,000 net new customers for Data Cloud. I've talked a little bit about the number of deals -- the number of wins over $1 million in Data Cloud doubled, and the average ARR per win more than tripled compared to last quarter -- pretty awesome. And we've now created a self-service switch so that every EE and UE customer can just flip it on. And engineering has just done a great job letting every customer become a Data Cloud customer.
Closed a lot of amazing deals in the quarter. Really excited about AWS. I know everyone has been talking about that, especially down at the conference this week at re:Invent, and we couldn't be more thrilled for our partnership with Andy Jassy, really excited. Really excited about our relationship with American Cancer Society doing -- they've been a customer for a long time, doing incredible work now seeing them use the Data Cloud, even becoming even more productive, more efficient. Group Global -- 30 million users now using Data Cloud, SiriusXM. Joe Inzerillo, great executive. We worked so closely with him at Disney, and one of the reasons that Disney has become wall-to-wall Salesforce. And nowadays at SiriusXM, he's deployed a great, incredible deployment of Data Cloud, but our -- actually our whole product line or so. Excited to work with Joe.
And this is really, I think, going to continue on as we start to talk more about customers who are using Data Cloud. I was just in Houston and had a great dinner down there with all of our customers. We had some phenomenal local country music performance at the dinner as well. The Ortega family did a great job cooking for us. Their restaurants are probably our favorite when we get on the road. But I'll tell you, Waste Management and Jim Fish, who I saw when I was in Houston, great executive, loves working with Jim. Here is a great company, North America's leading environmental sustaining -- sustainability solutions provider. Now, most of the folks on the call are probably customers. And, wow, they just have done an incredible implementation and now doing a great job implementing all the AI solutions as well.
Well, there's a lot more to talk about there. We've got so much going on, and March 8 is going to be a big day for Salesforce. We're going to turn 25 years old. It's hard to believe. At the same time, we've completely rebuilt the company, and so well positioned for the AI revolution, and we're lucky to have a great management team, and we've got them sitting here at the table.
Of course, we've got Mike Spencer here who is doing a great job running FP&A and IR. We have Sabastian, our new Chief Legal Officer; Amy, our new CFO. But Brian, why don't you take it from here and tell us what happened during the quarter?

Brian Millham
President, Chief Operating Officer at Salesforce
Yes, I really appreciate it, Marc. Thank you so much. I'm very pleased with the quarter, and it's really a testament to our laser focus on operational excellence, high performance, and profitable growth initiatives. We're seeing the results of our full-scale transformation of our company. In Q3, our non-GAAP operating margin is up an amazing 850 basis points year-over-year, and we reduced GAAP sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue by 6 full points. And we've matured our pricing and packaging to drive growth and simplify the buying experience.
As Marc said, we're well positioned to continue to drive profitable growth as we head into the largest quarter -- our largest quarter, and into next fiscal year. Despite the continued measured buying environment, we grew revenues in Q3, driven primarily by the strength of our product portfolio and multi-cloud transformational deals. In fact, the average size of our deal is greater than $1 million, as Marc said, was up 80% year-over-year, doubling our net new business in this segment. And for the third consecutive quarter, we saw add-on products like sales performance management, digital service, and sales productivity grow ARR nearly 40%. As customers look for quick time to value solutions and productivity gains, we saw traction with our new Salesforce Starter offering with nearly 1,000 new logos added this quarter. As the #1 AI CRM, companies in every industry and geography like Fujitsu, Southwest Airlines, ANZ Bank are turning to us as their trusted advisor to help them transform their business for the AI future. We're seeing amazing energy across our ecosystem with our partners, GSIs and ISVs, who are looking to do -- build more opportunities with us around our AI offerings. And we've established new partnerships with global management consulting companies like Bain and McKinsey. And as Marc mentioned, we're expanding our existing relationship with AWS.
It marks a significant milestone in the evolution of our global partnership with Amazon, deepening the integrations between AWS and Salesforce products. We're bringing together the #1 AI CRM and a leading public cloud provider to deliver an open integrated data and AI platform to make it easy to find, buy and manage Salesforce products to the AWS Marketplace.
Before I get into the product momentum, I want to share some operational highlights. We continue to effectively manage our expenses, as you've seen, and is reflected in our improved non-GAAP operating margin, which exceeded 31%. Today, our execution, inspection, and understanding of our customers' buying and approval process is better than ever. Our focus on high performance is a driver of growth is paying huge dividends in Q3. We saw more than a 30% increase in AE productivity year-over-year.
We're also refining and scaling our big deal motion and further bundling products to drive higher sales and simplify the buying experience for our customers. And we're doing all this while becoming more effective and efficient. I've been impressed with how quickly we deployed our own trusted generative AI tools and applications internally.
We've launched Sales GPT and Slack Sales Elevate internally, and our global support team is live with Service GPT, and we're seeing incredible results. We've streamlined our quoting process with automation, eliminating over 200,000 manual approvals so far this year. And since the introduction in September, our AI-driven chatbot has autonomously resolved thousands of employee-related queries without the need for human involvement.
We're seeing great success with our products and so our customers, which is clearly reflected in the high-level engagement and participation we're seeing in our events. In addition to Dreamforce, we hosted 80% of our top customers for the quarter. We also held an amazing 450 customer events in our offices with nearly $2 billion in pipeline.
And as we close out the year, we have a New York City World Tour coming up in December 14. I hope you all can join us in person. And if you can't, we hope you join us on Salesforce+.
We continue to hire selectively across key growth areas, especially in data cloud and AI, and we've seen the highest demand to join Salesforce in our history with the largest volume of applications in any quarter ever. Our growth initiatives across our core products, data, AI, industries, and international drove our strong performance in the quarter. And as Marc outlined, we're seeing strong momentum in Data Cloud and Einstein.
Importantly, we're already seeing high demand for our new premium UE+ bundle as customers recognize the value of our integrated solutions with Einstein AI functionality and Data Cloud built in. And our existing customers increased their spend with us by more than 70% when they upgraded to UE+. Industry clouds continue to be a tailwind to our growth, chosen by customers like Humana and U.S. Agency for internal development and RBC Wealth Management U.S. For the first time this quarter, nine of 13 industry clouds grew ARR above 50%.
We're seeing continued MuleSoft growth, which was an eight of our top 10 deals this quarter and delivered an amazing 140 billion automated flows, up 142% year-over-year. And Tableau, which is fully integrated to the Data Cloud, continues to help customers like Rubrik, Canara Bank, and U.S. Navy see and understand their data and make data-driven decisions.
In the quarter, we did continue to see the macro trends affect our business, in particular, our professional services business, our create and close sales motion and our Slack self-service business. Despite those headwinds, Slack was included in seven of our top 10 deals. Every day this quarter, there were 700 million Slack messages sent and 2.75 million workflows ran on the Slack platform. We recently announced Denise Dresser as the new CEO of Slack, and I've had the chance to work with Denise for a dozen years and could not be more thrilled for her, and importantly, for the Slack business.
Before I hand it off to Amy, I want to share some key number and highlights on how we deliver for our customers during Cyber Week. Commerce Cloud powered nearly 50 million orders on digital storefronts across Cyber Week with 100% uptime. Einstein powered more than 49 billion product recommendations and over 53 billion marketing messages were sent via the Marketing Cloud. In addition, Service Cloud helped our customers field and resolve 3.7 billion cases. This clearly demonstrates the scale and reliability of our #1 AI CRM platform.
So, in closing, we're heading into Q4 with a ton of energy and ambition, guiding our customers through a new innovation cycle with an unwavering commitment to their success. I, like Marc, am extremely proud of the team with the changes that we've made not just in Q3 but over the last year. And as I said earlier, we're well positioned for Q4 and as we head into fiscal year '25.
And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Amy.

Amy Weaver
Chief Financial Officer at Salesforce
Great. Thanks, Brian. Q3 represents another strong quarter of strong execution and discipline. As you heard from both Marc and Brian, we've transformed the company over the past 12 months to drive consistent, profitable growth, and we are pioneering the next wave of innovation with data, AI, CRM, and trust.
Now, let's get right to the results. For the third quarter, revenue was $8.7 billion, up 11% year over year and 10% in constant currency. This represents a $40 million beat in constant currency.
The growth was primarily driven by continued MuleSoft momentum and Resilient sales and service performance. From a geographic perspective, the Americas revenue grew 9%, EMEA grew 14% or 10% in constant currency, and APAC grew 18% or 21% in constant currency. We saw strong new business growth in India, Brazil, and Japan, while parts of EMEA were more constrained.
From an industry perspective, public sector performed very well while high tech and general continues to be more measured. And as Brian mentioned, our multi-cloud momentum continues. In Q3, nine of our top 10 deals included six or more clouds.
Q3 revenue attrition remained strong and ended the quarter again at approximately 8%. In Q3, our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.2%, up 850 basis points year-over-year. Our strong margin outperformance was driven by our continued disciplined investment strategy.
Q3 operating cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 389% year-over-year. Q3 free cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 1,088% year-over-year. This upside in cash flow was driven primarily by strong collections, as well as lower cash outflow that results to higher margins just discussed.
Now, turning to remaining performance obligations, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, ended Q3 at $48.3 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, ended at $23.9 billion, up 14% year over year and 13% in constant currency. This was ahead of expectations, primarily driven by strong early renewal performance as well as a large customer win in the quarter. This was partially offset by a one-point headwind from professional services that we had cautioned about last quarter.
Finally, we continue to deliver on our capital return commitment. In Q3, we returned another $1.9 billion in the form of share repurchases. And to date, we have exceeded our initial authorization of $10 billion in just over five quarters.
Before moving to guidance, I want to reiterate that we continue to assume a consistent measured customer buying environment. Let's start with full year fiscal year '24. On revenue, we are narrowing our guidance range to $34.75 billion to $34.8 billion, representing 11% growth year-over-year in nominal. We are now expecting a $50 million FX headwind, which implies a modest raise in constant currency.
On margins, we have made incredible progress on profitability and productivity this year. For fiscal year '24, we are very pleased to raise non-GAAP operating margin guidance again to 30.5%, representing an 800-basis-point improvement year-over-year. We also remain focused on stock-based compensation, which is now expected to be approximately 8% as a percent of revenue.
As a result of these updates, we now expect fiscal year '24 GAAP diluted EPS of $3.99 to $4, including estimated charges for the restructuring of $0.91. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is now expected to be $8.18 to $8.19. We are raising our fiscal year '24 operating cash flow growth guidance to approximately 30% to 33%, and this continues to include a 14- to 16-point headwind from restructuring. The upside in our cash flow guidance is driven by strong collections to date and our continued expense discipline.
Capex for the fiscal year is expected to be slightly below 2.5% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 33% to 36% for the fiscal year. And as we focus on shareholder return and disciplined capital allocation, we continue to expect to fully offset our stock-based compensation dilution through our share repurchases in fiscal year '24. In fact, as a result of our ongoing share repurchases, for the first time in company history, we expect the full year's ending share count to decrease year over year.
Now, to guidance for Q4. On revenue, we expect $9.18 billion to $9.23 billion, growth of 10% in both nominal and constant currency. CRPO growth for Q4 is expected to be 10% year over year in nominal and 11% in constant currency. Similar to this past quarter, we expect professional services headwinds of one point to CRPO growth.
For Q4, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.27 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.26. As we look forward to our largest quarter of the year, we remain focused on strong execution and our disciplined investment strategy.
In closing, I want to echo both Marc and Brian, this was a great quarter, but even more than that, this has been an extraordinary year of transformation. I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support, and I particularly want to thank our employees for their incredible work throughout the past year.
Now, Mike, let's open up the call for questions."

Chief Executive Officer and Director at NetApp
Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.
Q2 improved on our solid start to FY'24 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance while our operational discipline yielded company all-time highs for gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. We remain relentlessly focused on managing the elements within our control while driving better performance in our storage business and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive results from these actions, with increased profitability and a stronger position for delivering long-term growth.
In Q2, we held our INSIGHT User Conference where I witnessed the tangible excitement for the silo-free innovation our unified data storage provides. It was invigorating to be with the thousands of attendees and hear stories of the extraordinary outcomes NetApp delivers for our customers. NetApp is at the forefront of the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers turn disruption into opportunity with intelligent data infrastructure. Today's organizations need storage infrastructure that harnesses the power of public and hybrid clouds while keeping data secure and protected from ransomware attacks. They need infrastructure that supports dynamic workloads like AI, cloud-native, and open-source applications, and they need infrastructure that helps to create more sustainable data centers.
Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions based on one operating system, ONTAP, that supports any application, any data type, and spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments. This comprehensive architecture delivers unparalleled simplicity of management, simplicity of deployment, and consistency of automation, all unified by common APIs and a single control plane. We further elevate the customer experience with our BlueXP sustainability dashboard and NetApp Advance, a common set of programs and guarantees that include Storage Lifecycle Program which removes the burden of upgrade cycles, as well as storage efficiency, ransomware recovery, and data availability guarantees.
Intelligent data infrastructure combines unified data storage, integrated data services, and intelligent operations, so customers can operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unify their data for AI, and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth, and increased cybersecurity threats.
Looking at the results of the quarter, momentum from new products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year drove 10% quarter-over-quarter growth in Hybrid Cloud segment revenue to $1.4 billion. Our all-flash array business benefited from growth of the AFF C-series, increasing 14% from Q1 to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.2 billion. The AFF C-series all-flash array continues to exceed our expectations, delivering new-to-NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition.
In the quarter, we successfully competed against an all-flash competitor with C-series to win a $16 million deal at an Infrastructure-as-a-Service company. The customer was looking for new storage to host a broad variety of critical applications. Our ease of management for large storage environments, unique data resilience, common toolkit across all our storage systems, and the right price performance ratio secured our win, despite the competitor's attempt to use price once they realized their value proposition was insufficient. ONTAP One, our all-in-one software license that gives customers access to the industry's most comprehensive data management suite, has laid the groundwork for future tech refresh and expansion opportunities.
Building on the success of the C-series, we introduced block-optimized and AI-ready versions. The ASA C-series family is a solution tailored to deliver high-performance and guaranteed high availability storage for critical applications, databases, and VMware infrastructure, coupled with capacity flash to make enterprise-grade block storage more affordable and sustainable than ever. We added the AFF C-series to the ONTAP AI architecture, lowering the overall cost of entry to scalable AI without sacrificing performance.
Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering, is also growing rapidly. In Q2, we added performance and availability guarantees to Keystone, expanding on the existing sustainability and storage efficiency guarantees, creating a comprehensive program to keep storage operations running optimally. We also announced NetApp Storage on Equinix Metal, powered by Keystone, providing customers with a single subscription to a full stack of compute, networking, and storage infrastructure with low-latency interconnection to all major public clouds.
Turning to Public Cloud. As we said last quarter, our priority is growing first party cloud storage services. We aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners' go-to-market structures at the start of the fiscal year and are seeing new customer additions and growth in those services. However, that growth has been masked by weakness in subscription services, which have declined to 23% of Public Cloud ARR.
During the quarter, we engaged in a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio. As a result, we will continue to prioritize cloud storage offerings delivered through the hyperscalers, while refocusing some services, such as Cloud Insights and Instaclustr, to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings, creating greater differentiation and additional value for customers. We will integrate other services that are sold as standalone subscriptions today, such as data protection, into the core functionality of Cloud Volumes. We will also carefully manage the transition of cloud storage subscription services to align to customer preference for consumption offerings. And we have decided to exit the SaaS backup and virtual desktop services.
We anticipate ARR headwinds of approximately $55 million from exited services and unrenewed subscriptions in the second half of FY'24. Growth in first party and marketplace services are expected to partially offset this decline, positioning us to enter FY'25 with a more focused and much healthier business from which to grow.
Now to the results of the quarter. Public Cloud segment revenue in Q2 was $154 million, flat from Q1 and up 8% year-over-year. Our first party and marketplace offerings are highly differentiated and are tightly aligned with customers' buying preferences. These services grew over 30% from Q2 a year ago. We continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships, as well as increases in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR in this part of the portfolio.
In Q2, we extended our partnership with Google with the introduction of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. Now, we are not only the only vendor to have a natively integrated storage service in the public cloud, but we are natively integrated into all three of the leading hyperscale vendors. And we are not standing still with this advantage. Just two months after introducing the GCNV service, we announced the availability of a new lower-cost tier of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, expanding the offering to address a greater range of workloads. These partnerships uniquely position and enable us to participate in the innovation and adoption of AI services in the public cloud. As examples, during Q2, we announced support for Google Cloud's Vertex AI with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, as well as cross-protocol, hybrid cloud AI pipelines on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with support for SageMaker Studio notebooks.
Our position with the hyperscalers also enables us to displace legacy on-premises competitors as customers migrate workloads to the cloud. A US-based medical equipment company chose FSx for NetApp ONTAP to replace a competitor's SAN systems when they moved their database workloads to the cloud. This is the customer's first engagement with NetApp. Following a successful initial deployment, they are evaluating FSxN for workload consolidation and disaster recovery.
Looking forward, our focus is clear and is delivering results. We expect the momentum we saw in Q2 to continue through FY'24, despite continued softness in the demand environment due to the challenging macro. Customers value our modern approach to hybrid, multicloud infrastructure and data management which enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely, and sustainably. With recent innovations that enable us to address a broader set of markets more efficiently, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Mike.

Michael J. Berry
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at NetApp
Thank you, George. And good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a very solid quarter in what continues to be a challenging macro environment with soft IT spend. Our relentless focus and consistent execution delivered results that met and exceeded our guidance ranges and drove record-setting non-GAAP profitability measures across consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted.
Our modern, innovative solutions are resonating with customers and our disciplined operational management drove profitability margins to a record high. As we look ahead, we expect our industry leading solutions and unwavering focus to drive revenue growth and profitability in the second half of the fiscal year. Q2 consolidated gross margins of 72% were at an all-time high driven by product gross margins of 61%, also at an all-time high. Gross margin leverage and the returns on our strategic investments drove record operating margins of 27% and record EPS of $1.58.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $403 million to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing share count by 4% versus Q2 '23. Over the course of the year, we expect to return at least 100% of free cash flow to stockholders. Given our growth, profitability and working capital improvements, we expect operating cash flow for the full year to normalize and track relatively in-line with net income for the full year.
Due to our solid execution and operational efficiencies, we outperformed the second quarter and expect our continued focus and discipline to deliver year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of the year. As a result, we are raising all our guidance measures for FY24. Now, to the details of the quarter.
Q2 billings of $1.5 billion decreased 9% year-over-year, and revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 6% year-over-year, as IT budgets remain constrained in a challenging macro environment. Adjusting for the FX tailwind of 160 basis points, billings and revenue would have decreased 11% and 8% year-over-year, respectively.
Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 7% year-over-year, and product revenue of $706 million decreased 16% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, the first half of FY'23 revenue, and most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog entering FY'23. For the second half of FY'24 year-over-year comparisons should be more apples-to-apples. Support revenue, an attach to our install base and indicative of the value of our products, grew 3% year-over-year to $623 million. We are pleased with the momentum of our product portfolio and our go-to-market initiatives implemented at the start of FY'24.
Public Cloud revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $154 million and was relatively flat from Q1 '24. As George noted, year-over-year growth was driven by hyperscaler first party and marketplace services, partially offset by continued declines in subscription services.
Now, for our operating results. Q2 consolidated gross margin increased 580 basis points year-over-year to 72% and product gross margin increased 1,080 basis points year-over-year to 61%. Product gross margin benefited from three main factors. Number one, a mix shift to higher margin and higher capacity products. Number two, favorable COGs stemming from lower component costs and our strategic purchase agreements for NAND. Number three, price discipline in a cost sensitive, competitive pricing environment.
I want to be very clear on this point, there were no unusual or one-time transactions that drove the higher product gross margin results. As we discussed in prior calls, we continue to make strategic purchase commitments to lock-in NAND pricing and mitigate margin pressure from rising prices in the future, as NAND prices largely bottomed out in Q2.
Operating expenses of $706 million were flat year-over-year and grew $3 million quarter-over-quarter. Within a relatively consistent opex envelope, we will continue to reallocate investments to areas of higher opportunity to drive long-term growth. In Q2 operating margin increased 320 basis points year-over-year to 27%, which includes 80 basis points of FX tailwind. EPS grew 7% year-over-year to $1.58, which includes a $0.07 FX tailwind. These record results demonstrate the strength of our business model, product relevance and unwavering focus and execution.
As expected, Q2 operating cash flow of $135 million was impacted by seasonally lower collections and repatriation tax payments. DSO was 46 and inventory turns were 15. More importantly, year-to-date operating cash flow of $588 million grew 19% year-over-year compared to a decline of 8% the same period a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $97 million, bringing the year-to-date amount to $515 million, up 46% year-over-year.
During the quarter, we returned $403 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $230 million in net cash. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q2 was $4 billion. The slight decline year-over-year is driven by lower multi-year support and public cloud subscription billings. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Now turning to guidance. Given the success of our product portfolio and consistent execution on operational improvements, we are raising our FY'24 guidance in still a soft IT spending environment. We now expect FY'24 revenue to be down approximately 2% year-over-year, an improvement from our previous guidance. We expect to see continued strength in product and hyperscaler first-party and marketplace services as we work through minor headwinds from public cloud subscription services.
Consolidated gross margins are expected to be approximately 71%. For the second half, we expect product gross margins to range between 58% to 60% driven by continued mix shift to all-flash products and taking into account the current pricing environment and our commitment to maintain pricing flexibility. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 26% and EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.25 with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $30 million and share count of 212 million. Operating cash flow is expected to move in-line with net income, although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital.
In Q3, we expect revenue to range between $1.51 billion and $1.67 billion, which at the midpoint implies an increase of 4% year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margins to be roughly 71%, and operating margin to be approximately 28%. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.74.
In closing, I want to thank our customers, employees and investors once again for their steadfast commitment and investment in NetApp. I remain confident in our ability to manage the elements in our control and focus our key priorities to help customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud journeys. Our portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments, and we are committed to delivering sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris?"
5,Walmart,Q4,"Doug McMillon
President and Chief Executive Officer at Walmart
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to talk about our third quarter results and how we're seeing the rest of the year. Our value proposition continues to resonate with customers, helping us gain share and drive e-commerce growth. We're on track to grow adjusted operating income at a faster rate than sales for the year, consistent with what we discussed at our investor meeting earlier this year.
We had strong revenue growth for the quarter across each of our segments. Comp sales for Walmart U.S. were 4.9% and 3.8% for Sam's Club U.S. Sales for Walmart International were up 5.4% in constant currency, led by Walmex and China. Sam's Club continues to perform well, both in Mexico and China. And while strength was broad-based for Walmex, our Bodega Aurrera business is worth calling out as it continues to deliver outstanding growth.
E-commerce sales were up 24% in Walmart U.S., 16% in Sam's Club U.S., and 15% globally. Timing of our Flipkart Big Billion Days event, which moved from Q3 last year to Q4 this year, affected comparisons in our international segment, leading to a decline of 3%. So we'll see the benefit from the timing shift as we report next quarter.
Across markets, the team did a nice job driving our seasonal events. Our in-stock and inventory levels are in good shape. We finished down 1.2% in inventory for the total Company, including down 5% for Walmart U.S. Both our top line and adjusted EPS came in better than what we projected at the beginning of the quarter, but we could have done a better job on expenses, which is reflected in adjusted operating income growing less than we expected. We had a couple of unexpected expense increases in SG&A, and you'll hear more about those when John David walks through the numbers.
In the U.S., pricing levels in many food categories continue to be a concern. Overall, our product costs are up versus last year, and they remain up even more on a two-year stack, which is putting pressure on our customers. Beef prices are high, but we're happy to see lower pricing in dairy, on eggs and with chicken and seafood. The pockets of disinflation we are seeing are helping, but we'd like to see more faster, especially in the dry grocery and consumables categories.
The other good news is that general merchandise prices continue to come down. GM is down low- to mid-single digits versus last year. That enables us to roll back pricing, which will help our customers during this holiday season when general merchandise is so important for gift giving. We still see pressure from mix, including outside the U.S., which we expected, but I like the market share gains we're seeing in this category.
In the U.S., we may be managing through a period of deflation in the months to come. And while that would put more unit pressure on us, we welcome it because it's better for our customers.
When I look at our P&L, it's continuing to change shape. Mentally, I'd break it down as a combination of a traditional retail P&L and a newer version that starts with our digital businesses. It flows from first and third-party e-commerce pickup and delivery to businesses like membership, advertising and fulfillment as a service. It includes some faster-growing, higher-margin components that combined with the more traditional P&L, gives us a business model that's more profitable in percentage terms as it grows. We saw strong growth in all of these areas for the quarter. And when you put it together with the supply chain automation work we're doing, you get a more sustainable business that can grow more effectively over time and create a better mix along the way.
Marketplace is one of our engines for these mutually reinforcing businesses, meaning that marketplace growth pulls other businesses like fulfillment through. Back in September, we held our first-ever Marketplace Seller Summit. We hosted thousands of current and potential sellers to let them see firsthand our commitment to this business and how we'll grow it together.
Since the beginning of last year, we've more than doubled the number of items available to customers on our U.S. marketplace. It's an important piece of what we're building, and it's growing fast and not just in the U.S. We have a unique opportunity to grow in India, Mexico, Canada and Chile. We love the opportunity to grow our assortment this way so customers can get what they want, when and how they want it.
We're making shopping easier and more convenient. Our net promoter scores for pickup and delivery in Walmart U.S. are improving, and we started using generative AI to improve our search and chat experience. We've released an improved beta version of search to some of our customers who are using our app on iOS. In the coming weeks and months, we'll enhance this experience and roll it out to more customers.
When I step back and look at the Company overall, I love what we're building and how we're building it. We've got a good hand to play and a strong team making things happen. It's our recipe for growth and improved margin and returns we've been discussing with you.
Everyday low prices are a foundational component of us fulfilling our purpose. We bring EDLP to life on a year-round basis by doing things like offering a Thanksgiving meal in the U.S. and Canada that cost less than last year. We're offering tremendous value for things like fashion, electronics and seasonal decorations, and helping remind people that when they're looking to buy toys, we're the place to come because we have the right product at the right price.
This same focus on purpose and execution came through when I was visiting Chile, Canada and China earlier this quarter. It was my first time back in China since before the pandemic. Our team there runs some of the most incredible Sam's Clubs in the world, and they continue to be a leader for us in terms of digital penetration and innovation.
As a wrap-up, I know we're all concerned about events across the world or acts of terror, political unrest, impacts from storms like those in Mexico from Hurricane Otis, the pressure we're feeling from stubborn inflation in some categories and other challenges beyond our control. As for our Company, we care about everyone. We want to be a place where literally everyone feels comfortable and welcomed to shop or work. We want to live our values and create a warm, safe and fun place for the hundreds of millions of people that will shop with us in the days and weeks ahead. I'm grateful to be part of this big team, grateful to work alongside our associates.
Now I'll turn it over to John David.

John David Rainey
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Walmart
I'd like to start by thanking our customers, members, associates and partners for helping us deliver a good quarter. We're pleased overall with how the team executed and how our strong value proposition and omnichannel strategy continue to resonate with customers. We're gaining share, seeing strong e-commerce growth and excited about the contributions from higher-margin businesses like advertising.
Sales grew more than 4%, gross profit was better than expected, and we exceeded our guidance for EPS. These results reinforce the benefits of our highly diversified business with broad-based contributions across segments and markets, channels and formats, and strategic growth areas.
While we're pleased with our top line results, operating income was below our guidance due to higher-than-anticipated expenses, largely certain legal accruals. I'll provide more details on guidance shortly, but the key takeaway is that we're raising our full year sales and EPS guide while reiterating our prior operating income guidance. We expect the relationship between profit and sales growth to favor profitability in Q4 and for the full year to align with our goal of operating income growing faster than sales.
Now let me review the key financial highlights for Q3 using our financial framework of growth, margins and returns. First, growth. Constant currency sales increased 4.4% or nearly $7 billion. Importantly, we saw traffic growth across both in-store and digital channels. All three operating segments experienced mid-single-digit sales growth with comp sales for Walmart U.S. up 4.9%, and Sam's Club U.S. up 3.8%, excluding fuel.
International grew sales 5.4% in constant currency with Walmex sales up more than 9% and China up 25% with strong performance in Sam's Club and e-commerce. The timing of Flipkart's Big Billion Days pressured international sales growth as the event moved from Q3 last year to Q4 this year. So we expect the timing to be a benefit to Q4's growth rate for the segment.
PhonePe also continued its strong momentum with annualized TPV, or total payment volume, reaching 1.2 trillion on nearly 5.8 billion monthly transactions. And PhonePe recently achieved an impressive milestone, eclipsing 500 million registered users.
We continue to grow share in key categories, particularly in Walmart U.S. grocery where we delivered positive comps and saw strong share gains in both units and dollars. Grocery inflation moderated nearly 300 basis points from Q2 levels to a mid-single-digit increase versus last year. But on a two-year stack, it was still elevated at a high-teens percentage. We see our customers showing ongoing discretion in seeking value to manage within their household budget.
While general merchandise sales were down low-single digits year-over-year in Q3, the rate of change was stable to Q2 levels and we gained share across categories. As we enter the holiday season, we're working hard to lower grocery prices to ease the pressure for customers, giving them more capacity for general merchandise spend.
Our business is rooted in a timeless purpose to save customers money so they can live better. Against any economic backdrop, we're there for customers, how and where they need us. And we're making shopping with Walmart and Sam's Club more convenient.
Omni services, including pickup and store-fulfilled delivery continue to drive strong growth, leading to a 24% increase in Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales and 16% growth at Sam's Club. Multi-channel shoppers are more valuable, engaging more often and spending more with us. Pickup and delivery for Walmart U.S. has been a key source of growth and share gains among upper-income households and has become the most productive channel for acquiring Walmart+ members.
In international, Walmex' expansion of omni offerings led to 1.5 million Bodega store-fulfilled digital orders in Q3. In Canada, we continue to roll out our unlimited next-day store delivery subscription called Delivery Pass, which is now available from two-thirds of our Canada stores. And I was in China recently where our business is nearly a 50-50 split of physical and digital. I was impressed with how we're serving omni customers with speed and accuracy through new engagement and delivery models.
Turning to margins. Gross margins expanded 32 basis points, reflecting the timing shift of Big Billion Days in India and lapping last year's LIFO charge at Sam's Club U.S. Walmart U.S. gross margins increased 5 basis points, reflecting lower markdowns in supply chain costs, but we're still seeing ongoing category mix pressure as health and wellness and grocery sales outperformed general merchandise. Continued disinflation, along with the success of our merchants at Sam's Club and bringing down the cost of inventory, resulted in us not taking the expected $50 million LIFO charge in Q3. We no longer expect any further LIFO charges in Sam's Club this year.
As we've said previously, over the next several years, we expect margins to move higher as we modernize our supply chain and scale higher-margin growth initiatives. We made good progress on both during the quarter.
We continue to deploy capital to build technologies and optimize our next-generation supply chain with automation and productivity benefits starting to appear in our results. We now operate nine regional distribution centers servicing U.S. stores with varying levels of automation, with six more centers in active stages of construction. Currently, more than 15% of stores receive merchandise from these facilities, helping to get product to shelves faster and more efficiently.
During the quarter, we opened our third next-generation e-commerce fulfillment center. These 1.5 million square feet facilities are expected to more than double the storage capacity, enable 2x the number of customer orders fulfilled daily and will expand next and two-day shipping to nearly 90% of the U.S., including marketplace items shipped by Walmart Fulfillment Services. They also unlock new opportunities for our associates to transition to higher skilled tech-focused positions.
To support the store-fulfilled digital business, we're on track to have seven stores with automated market fulfillment centers, or MFCs, operational by the end of this month. These MFCs stock thousands of the most sought-after items and are expected to increase order capacity and productivity while also increasing inventory accuracy, which helps us deliver perfect orders for customers.
As we focus on improving e-commerce margins, we're making good progress in lowering digital fulfillment cost and densifying the last mile by tapping our broad store and club network. Over the past year, Walmart U.S. has increased the percentage of digital orders fulfilled by stores by 800 basis points and Sam's Club fulfills nearly 60% of online orders from its clubs.
With the growth of our Spark Driver platform, we've lowered store-to-home delivery costs by 15%, even as we shortened delivery times to same day for more than 80% of our stores and in some cases, as quick as 30 minutes. As we scale Walmart GoLocal, we're densifying the last mile, and we're approaching a milestone of 12 million deliveries for other retailers with this service.
I'd like to touch on our portfolio of higher growth initiatives. These businesses reinforce our core omni-retail model and are key to driving operating income growth ahead of sales over time. In Q3, this portfolio positively contributed to gross margins. Global advertising grew approximately 20% in Q3, with Sam's MAP growing over 27% and Walmart Connect up 26%.
As an illustration of the omnichannel benefits of our ad platforms, more than 75% Sam's MAP active advertisers are investing in search and sponsored ads as in-club sales attribution has improved returns of digital ad spend by over 30%. International's ad revenue growth was impacted by the timing of Big Billion Days, but we're on track to deliver strong growth of approximately 45% for the full year.
Moving to marketplace and fulfillment services. Customer engagement continues to validate our strategies to invest in ways to grow this business on a global basis. As Doug mentioned, we held the inaugural Marketplace Seller Summit to help accelerate our marketplace growth.
For cross-border sellers in the U.S., we're expanding access to more customers beyond the U.S., Canada and Mexico by opening our e-commerce marketplace in Chile to cross-border products next year. Over the past year, we've increased marketplace sellers by more than 20%, and the number of sellers utilizing Walmart Fulfillment Services is up over 55%.
Next, membership remains a compelling way we deepen engagement with our customers. Sam's Club membership income grew over 7%, reflecting record member counts and Plus member penetration. During Q3, we held events that were focused on member acquisition and digital engagement. We'll take a similar approach again during Q4, offering discounted access to Walmart+ memberships while providing members early access to the best savings event throughout the holiday season.
Turning back to the middle of the P&L. SG&A expenses deleveraged 37 basis points on an adjusted basis, impacted by higher year-over-year wage-related cost in Walmart U.S., including higher variable pay expenses relative to last year when we were below our planned performance. Store remodel costs were also higher as we rolled out 117 of our flagship design stores earlier this month, and legal expenses increased. Lastly, the timing shift of Big Billion Days pressured international expense leverage in Q3. We'll see the benefit come through in Q4.
Third quarter adjusted operating income grew 3%, including 270 basis points of currency tailwind, while adjusted EPS of $1.53 increased 2% and compared favorably to guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. Relative to our guidance, Q3 EPS benefited by $0.01 from releasing the LIFO reserve we had earmarked for Sam's Club.
Moving to returns. Over the last 12 months, sales have grown more than 6% and operating income increased about 22%. And when combined with a disciplined capital approach, return on investment improved 130 basis points to 14.1%. The primary driver was lapping last year's Q3 charge related to the opioid legal settlement framework.
ROI also reflects some benefits from productivity initiatives that we initially expected to realize in FY '25. We continue to expect our ROI to increase over the coming years. In addition to our strategy, our financial position is an advantage and enables us to compete in an increasingly dynamic retail environment.
Turning to guidance. We're confident in our agility and our ability to execute, and we're focusing our investment in areas where we can widen our omni advantage, deepen engagement and drive sustained growth in new revenue streams. We like our position relative to competitors as we've maintained strong price gaps and increased share while preserving flexibility to respond to competitive dynamics, but we're not immune from the vagaries of the economy.
We see our customers showing ongoing discretion in making trade-offs to be able to afford the things they want, given the sustained high cost of the things they need. Recently, we've experienced a higher degree of variability in weekly performance in between holiday events in the U.S., including seeing a softening in the back half of October that was off trend to the rest of the quarter.
Sales during November have turned higher as unseasonal weather abated and we kicked off holiday events. So sales have been somewhat uneven, and this gives us reason to think slightly more cautiously about the consumer versus 90 days ago. We still expect sales growth to moderate in Q4 versus prior quarters as grocery inflation further normalizes towards historic levels, but we're encouraged by the increased traffic and share gains we've seen and expect them to continue.
As such, we're modestly raising our full year sales guidance to 5% to 5.5% from 4% to 4.5% previously, primarily to reflect Q3's outperformance. For operating income, we're maintaining the guidance range of 7% to 7.5% growth. In addition to the 40 basis points of unexpected legal expenses in Q3, we also expect to record charges in Q4, totaling approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points related to unplanned store closures and recovery costs associated with the recent hurricane near Acapulco, Mexico. This impacted 28 of our stores, and less than half of them have been reopened at this time.
Partially offsetting these costs is the approximate 40 basis point benefit from lower-than-expected LIFO charges compared to our prior guide. The net effect is a 20 basis point to 30 basis point headwind to our prior guide and as such, we currently expect to be in the lower end of the operating income growth range for the year.
We expect merchandise mix pressure to continue in Q4 with grocery and health and wellness sales rates outpacing general merchandise and potentially be a bit more pronounced given the uncertain consumer environment. Based on Q3 results, and less of an increase in interest cost for the year than we previously expected, we're raising our full year EPS guidance range to $6.40 to $6.48.
In closing, let me reiterate what I said previously. Aligned with our financial framework, we expect the relationship between profit and sales growth to favor profitability in Q4 and for the full year operating income to grow faster than sales. We like our competitive position. Our financial results clearly demonstrate that our omnichannel strategy is winning. We're growing our share across categories, deepening customer engagement across channels while investing in areas to widen our competitive advantage. The holidays are here and our value proposition resonates with customers looking to save money as they celebrate.
Operator, we'd now like to open the line for questions."

Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin, this week, we announced that Hugh Johnston will be joining the Walt Disney Company as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, after 34 years with PepsiCo. It's great to have Hugh joining Disney at this important moment for our company. I'd also like to thank Kevin Lansberry, who stepped into the CFO role on an interim basis earlier this year and has provided strong leadership in the month since. Kevin is returning to his role as CFO of our Disney Experiences segment, and you'll hear more from him in just a bit. Now let's turn to the quarter.
Our results this quarter speak volumes about the underlying strength of our company and a remarkable amount of work we have accomplished this past year. Q4 adjusted earnings per share nearly tripled over the prior year. And all three of our businesses: Entertainment, Experiences and Sports saw significant increases in fourth quarter operating income compared to Q4 of fiscal '22. The thorough restructuring of our company has enabled tremendous efficiencies, and we're on track to achieve roughly $7.5 billion in cost reductions, which is approximately $2 billion more than we targeted earlier this year.
Our new structure also enabled us to greatly enhance their effectiveness, particularly in streaming, where we've created a more unified, cohesive and highly coordinated approach to marketing, pricing and programming. This has helped us improve operating results of our combined streaming businesses by approximately $1.4 billion from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023. And we remain confident that we will achieve profitability in Q4 of fiscal 2024. And most importantly, our new structure has restored creativity to the center of our company, and we certainly know from our now 100-year history that nothing is more important or critical to our success. Indeed, our strong creative accomplishments helped drive impressive growth in core Disney+ subs with nearly $7 million added in the quarter.
This reflects the success of numerous popular titles to hit the platform, including Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, the Little Mermaid and Elemental, continuing the trend of our theatrical releases being some of the most watched content on Disney+. Key originals also performed incredibly well across all our platforms, including Ahsoka on Disney+, the Kardashians, which is now our most viewed unscripted Hulu original series ever, and the spectacular Korean original series, Moving, which has become a breakout hit. As I reflect on our achievement this past year, I'm mindful of the fact that a lot of time and effort was spent on fixing, both contending with certain decisions made in the recent past, and addressing the numerous challenges brought on by disruption and the pandemic. And while we still have work to do to continue improving results, our progress has allowed us to move beyond this period of fixing and begin building our businesses again. As we look forward, we are focusing on four key building opportunities that will be central to our success.
And they are achieving significant and sustained profitability in our streaming business, building ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, improving the output and economics of our film studios and turbocharging growth in our experiences business. We have already made considerable progress on these four opportunities, and we will continue to move forward with a sense of purpose and urgency. I've articulated many of my thoughts about our strategic initiatives. So today, I want to discuss in more detail these four building opportunities as we enter this next phase. First is turning streaming into a profitable growth business. And I'm pleased to say our recent performance solidifies that we are on that path. In the four years since we launched Disney+, which generated roughly 10 million sign-ups in the first 24 hours alone, core Disney+ subscribers have now reached over $112 million as of the end of fiscal '23, including the nearly seven million we gained this quarter.
What's more, our ad-supported Disney+ products grew by approximately two million subscriptions in Q4 to a total of 5.2 million. In fact, more than 50% of Q4 new U.S. subscribers chose an ad-supported Disney+ product. And over the past six months, these AVOD subs spent 34% more time watching the service. We have the best advertiser technology in the streaming business globally and we have just introduced new tools that will make this an even more attractive platform for advertisers much as we've done with Hulu. And speaking of Hulu, we were pleased to announce last week that we will acquire the remaining stake in Hulu held by Comcast, which will further Disney streaming objectives. We remain on track to roll out a more unified one app experience domestically, making extensive general entertainment content available to bundle subscribers via Disney+.
That includes critical and audience favorites like Hulu's Only Murders in the Building, The Bear, Abbott Elementary as well as titles from our extensive content library built over a decade, including adult animation standouts like Family Guy and long-running hit series like 911, which is moving to ABC for season 7. We expect that Hulu on Disney+ will result in increased engagement, greater advertising opportunities, lower churn and reduced customer acquisition costs thereby increasing our overall margins. We will launch a beta version for bundled subscribers in December, giving parents time to set up profiles and parental controls that work best for their families ahead of the official launch in early spring 2024. Also, we have additional opportunities for improvement in our streaming business that will come from implementing stronger standards around account sharing.
Although given the timing of our planned rollout, we don't expect a meaningful impact until 2025. Now that we have realigned our pricing and marketing strategies, focused aggressively on getting the technology right, merged our creative and distribution teams and restored creative excellence is our singular motivating priority with the content we create. We are bullish about the future of our streaming business. And as you consider the components and the future of that business, just imagine the opportunities that have further combined Disney+, Hulu and ESPN streaming experience could offer us as a company and our consumers. Another core building opportunity is taking ESPN, which is already the world's leading sports brand and turning it into the preeminent digital sports platform, allowing us to reach fans in compelling new ways and fully integrating key features into our primary ESPN offering.
We're already moving quickly down this path, and we are exploring strategic partnerships to help advance our efforts through marketing, technology, distribution and additional content. As we continue to develop our streaming business, the continued strength of ESPN relative to the backdrop of notable linear industry declines demonstrates the value of sports and the power of the ESPN brand. Overall, our domestic ESPN business grew in revenue and operating income in both fiscal '22 and in fiscal '23. This fiscal year also saw the network delivered its best overall viewership in four years and its highest viewership in the key 18 to 49 demographic in the same time period. ESPN viewership was up in each of the four quarters as well, maintaining steady success throughout the entire year. Across ESPN networks, the company increased its already industry-leading share of sports viewership in fiscal '23, and we continue to see stability in ad sales despite challenges facing the broader media industry.
ESPN BET will launch next week through our agreement with Penn Entertainment, and we are excited to bring sports fans this compelling new experience. Regarding our broader linear business, we continue to evaluate options for each of our linear networks with the goal of identifying the best strategic path for the company and maximizing shareholder value. However, our review of the business thus far has uncovered significant long-term cost opportunities, which we're implementing while continuing to deliver high-quality content. Speaking of which, I'd like to acknowledge the world-class journalists and producers at ABC News. Over the past few months, many have risked their lives to keep our audiences informed during relentless news cycles and made ABC number one in network news for the 11th consecutive year. Next is the need to strengthen the creative output of our film studio which generates value throughout the entire company.
To achieve this, we are focusing heavily on the core brands and franchises that fuel all of our businesses and reducing output overall to enable us to concentrate on fewer projects and improve quality, while continuing our effort around the creation of fresh and compelling original IP. I'm devoting considerably more of my time to this with the goal of improving returns always seeking to exceed the level of creative excellence audiences expect from Disney. Meanwhile, we have four of the top 10 highest grossing films of the global box office this year, including Pixar's Elemental, which has grossed nearly $0.5 billion worldwide in addition to being the most viewed film released this year on Disney+. We have more new releases still to come in calendar year '23, including The Marvels from Marvel studio, which will be released this Friday and Wish our newest film from Walt Disney Animation Studios which marks our company's 100th anniversary and will be in theaters beginning November 22.
We're also looking forward to our strong theatrical slate in '24, with several films tied to popular franchises like Deadpool three featuring Wolverine, Kingdom of the Planet Apes and Inside Out 2. Additionally, Mufasa: The Lion King and sequels from our Toy Story, Frozen, Zootopia and Avatar franchises are all in the works. Finally, we have an opportunity to build Disney experiences into an even bigger and more successful cash flow generation business. Parks and Experiences overall remains a growth story and we are managing our portfolio exceptionally well. Even in the case of Walt Disney World, where we have a tough comparison to the prior year, when you look at this year's numbers compared to pre-pandemic levels, in fiscal '19, we have seen growth in revenue and operating income of over 25% and 30%, respectively.
Over the last five years, return on invested capital has nearly doubled in our domestic parks and we have seen sizable increases over that same time frame across the total experiences portfolio as well. Not to mention the improved guest experience ratings we're now seeing at every one of our parks. As we announced in September, we plan to turbocharge growth in our experiences business through strategic investments over the next decade. Given our wealth of IP innovative technology, buildable land, unmatched creativity and strong returns on invested capital, we're confident about the potential from our new investments. Looking at the company as a whole. Today, we are focused on driving profitable growth and value creation as we move from a period of fixing to a new era of building. We have a strong balance sheet, and we expect free cash flow to significantly improve in fiscal '24, approaching pre-COVID levels.
Disney's Experiences business with its expansive offerings around the world is a key differentiator and remains a powerful growth engine expanding operating margins by nearly 300 basis points over the past five years. As we transition ESPN to a streaming future, and more fully integrate general entertainment content into Disney+, we will have a DTC offering unlike any other in the industry. And Disney's leadership and workforce around the world are second to none. When you combine all of that with our unrivaled portfolio of valuable businesses, brands and assets and the way we manage them together, Disney has a strong hand that differentiates us from others in the industry. Our results this quarter are a testament to the work we've done across the company this past year, and I'm bullish about the opportunities we have to create lasting growth and shareholder value and to strengthen Disney's position as the world's leading entertainment company.
And with that, I will turn things over to Kevin.

Kevin Lansberry
Chief Financial Officer at Walt Disney
Thank you, Bob. I appreciate your kind words at the outset of the call. It's been an honor serving as Interim CFO these past few months. We are excited to welcome Hugh to The Walt Disney Company, and I look forward to working with both of you on all this ahead. Now to dive into this quarter's results. Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, increased versus the prior year to $0.82 in the fiscal fourth quarter and $3.76 for the full fiscal year. This past year has been marked by both transformation and execution, and we are pleased with the momentum we are building and the results we've realized, including meeting our guide of high single-digit percentage growth in both revenue and operating income for fiscal 2023. Total company revenues for the year increased 7% and segment operating income grew by 8%, excluding the impact of accelerated depreciation from the Galactic Starcruiser. And free cash flow for the year increased substantially, totaling close to $5 billion, driven by the work we've been doing on the cost efficiency front and by improvement in our underlying financial results.
A few weeks ago, we published our recast financials aligned to our newly reorganized segment structure. Today, I'll be walking through the fourth quarter's financial results for each of our three segments, Entertainment, Sports and Experiences, and I'll also provide some color for the year ahead. Starting off with Entertainment. Q4 operating income grew by over $800 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by improvement in our direct-to-consumer business. We continue to make headway on our path to profitability and streaming with fourth quarter operating losses at our entertainment DTC services improving by nearly $1 billion versus the prior year or $85 million sequentially to $420 million. Note that our entertainment direct-to-consumer results exclude ESPN+, including ESPN+ our combined streaming businesses and an operating loss in the fourth quarter of $387 million, a year-over-year improvement of a little over $1 billion and a sequential improvement of $125 million.
As Bob noted earlier, we added nearly seven million Disney+ core subs over the past quarter, reflecting strong content performance and our global summer promotion. Disney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by $0.12, driven by pricing increases and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by the impact of the summer promotion. The Disney+ ad tier added approximately two million subs during the fourth quarter and ended the fiscal year with 5.2 million subscribers. We anticipate core Disney+ subscribers in fiscal Q1 will decline slightly versus Q4 due to the expected temporary uptick in churn from the recent U.S. price increases as well as from the end of the summer promotion. However, we expect to see sub growth rebound later in the fiscal year. Growth in entertainment, B2C advertising revenue of 4% in Q4 versus the prior year, partially offset linear ad declines. The growth reflects an increase at Disney+, while Hulu results declined due to lower political and technology category advertising.
We continue to expect to reach profitability at our combined streaming businesses in Q4 of fiscal 2024. Although as we have mentioned in the past, we don't expect linear progress from quarter-to-quarter. While we expect entertainment B2C operating losses in Q1 to be generally in line with Q4 due to higher sports rights costs at ESPN+ aligned with the start of the NHL season. We anticipate a modest sequential decline in Q1 for the combined streaming business. But as we have also said previously, we anticipate upward momentum later in the fiscal year to be driven by realizing the full impact of price increases, the launch of the ad tier internationally and subscriber growth. At linear networks, which now excludes our sports channels, fourth quarter operating income was flat to the prior year, reflecting lower advertising and affiliated revenues which were generally offset by a decrease in marketing and programming and production costs.
Advertising revenue declines were driven by our domestic business, primarily at ABC and our own TV stations. Domestic entertainment affiliate revenue decreased by 4% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year due to a six-point decline from fewer subscribers and a 1.5 point adverse impact from the Charter blackout, partially offset by a roughly 4-point impact from higher rates. As Bob mentioned, we remain focused on driving additional cost efficiencies in this business over the long term. Content sales, licensing and other lower operating results versus the prior year were due to lower theatrical results, partially offset by higher home entertainment results. We currently expect that first quarter operating income will be roughly breakeven and comparable to prior year. Moving to our Sports segment. Q4 operating income increased by 14% versus the prior year. Results were driven by our domestic ESPN business from lower programming and production costs.
Growth in subscription revenue at ESPN due to both pricing and sub growth and lower marketing costs, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs reflect the absence of the Big Ten. In domestic, ESPN linear advertising revenue increased by 1% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. Despite the absence of the Big Ten, the Charter blackout in a highly competitive marketplace. Domestic affiliate revenue decreased by a little less than 5% in Q4 versus the prior year, as 5.5 points of growth from higher rates were offset by adverse impacts of approximately 7.5 points from fewer subscribers and two points from the Charter blackout. As Bob referenced earlier, it's worth noting that ESPN's domestic business grew both full year revenue and operating income in each of the last two years. These results give us confidence in our belief that sports has the power to drive value for the company even in the face of challenging industry headwinds.
Finally, at Experiences. Fourth quarter operating results increased by over 30% versus the prior year quarter and 27% versus fiscal '19. Operating margins at the segment were 22% in Q4, an increase of three percentage points versus the prior year. Our international operations continued their strong performance trend in the quarter with significant growth across all sites versus the prior year. Disney Cruise Line, Disney Vacation Club and Disneyland Resort also all saw strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and operating income. At Walt Disney World, operating results decreased, driven by the accelerated depreciation from the closure of the Galactic Starcruiser, along with inflationary impacts and the continued comparison to the 50th anniversary celebration in the prior year. Looking towards fiscal 2024, we anticipate robust annual operating income growth, ad experiences to reflect continued strong performance at our international parks and Disney Cruise Line.
While domestic parks and experiences is expecting solid growth for the full year, that growth will be heavily back-end loaded due to continued challenging comparisons in the first half of the year from the 50th anniversary at Walt Disney World in addition to wage inflation. We continue to be bullish on the long-term positioning of our experiences business. As evidenced by our recent announcement on significant investments we plan to make over the next 10 years to turbocharge growth in this area. We expect those investments to ramp up towards the back half of that 10-year period with more gradual increases in the first few years. As has been the case historically, capex for the parks are largely effectively self-funded given the strong returns these investments generate over time. And I would also note that a portion of the investments in our theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong is funded out of joint venture cash flows.
Before we conclude and move to Q&A, there are a number of additional items I'd like to share for context on the year ahead. First, on capital expenditures. Fiscal 2023 capex totaled approximately $5 billion, roughly comparable to the prior year and in line with our most recent guidance. And we expect capex in fiscal 2024 to total $6 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion versus fiscal 2023, driven by higher spend Experiences. capex Experiences in fiscal 2024 will look more comparable to fiscal 2019 levels and includes spend at our cruise business ahead of the launch of three new ships in fiscal 2025 and 2026. Our enterprise-wide content spend in fiscal 2023 was $27 billion, in line with our guidance and about $3 billion below the prior year as we significantly reduced our spend on entertainment content. As a result of our continued work to be more efficient in our content spend, in addition to impacts from the strikes and the timing of sports payments we expect total content spend in fiscal 2024 to be approximately $25 billion, which is a decrease of $2 billion versus 2023.
Note that Sports rights now account for over 40% of our enterprise-wide content spend. Our annualized entertainment cash content spend reduction target is now $4.5 billion, excluding strike impacts and sports rights versus $3 billion previously. We expect this to be realized on a cash basis in fiscal 2024, although it will take a few years for the bulk of these savings to be reflected in the P&L due to the timing of amortization. On the topic of cost savings and streamlining our operations, we have eliminated over 8,000 roles. And while we are not currently planning to make further large-scale reductions to our workforce, we are taking significant concrete steps to continue addressing the cost basis of the overall company. We have increased our annualized efficiency target for total company SG&A and other operating expenses to $3 billion versus $2.5 billion previously, including the strike impacts. Approximately $2 billion of these efficiencies were achieved in fiscal 2023.
Naturally, we also saw inflation and volume-related cost increases throughout the year, including higher content amortization and costs related to expanded operations at international parks and cruise, which were impacted by closures and limited operating capacity in the prior year. The remainder of these savings are expected to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2024. Our expense base in fiscal 2024 is expected to only increase slightly versus the prior year. As these efficiencies and strike savings will mostly offset the year's planned volume-related growth and inflation. Adding the new $4.5 billion cash content spend reduction target to the $3 billion expense target brings our total annualized target to $7.5 billion, as Bob announced earlier.
All of these factors, in addition to continued growth and improvement across our underlying businesses are expected to come together over the coming fiscal year to result in free cash flow generation of roughly $8 billion, a significant year-over-year increase and approaching levels we last achieved pre-pandemic. This continued robust free cash flow growth, alongside our strong balance sheet will position us well to address our investments and shareholder return goals for the year end going forward. To that end, we will be recommending to the Board that they declare a dividend by the end of this calendar year. While this will be just the starting point, we do see ample opportunity continue to increase shareholder returns in the future as our earnings and free cash flow grow in the form of increased dividends or share buybacks and we look forward to sharing more as we move ahead.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Alexia for Q&A."
7,eBay,Q4,"Jamie Iannone
President and Chief Executive Officer at eBay
Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Our teams delivered solid results during the third quarter. We generated gross merchandise volume of approximately $18 billion, while revenue grew 4% to $2.5 billion. We delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, up 3%, while returning over $780 million of capital to shareholders. We achieved these results despite continued challenges in the global macro environment. Inflationary pressures and rising interest rates continue to weigh on consumer confidence and pressure demand for discretionary goods.
As Steve will discuss in greater detail, we've observed softening consumer trends to date in Q4 and particular challenges in Europe, suggesting we may see a more muted seasonal uptick over the holidays. We are focused on controlling what we can control, being prudent about our costs, leaning in operational efficiencies and continuing to drive innovation for our customers. Last quarter, I discussed our vision of reinventing the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts, which is focused on three strategic pillars: relevant experiences, scalable solutions and magical innovation.
And I'm pleased that we made meaningful progress against each of these pillars during Q3, which I'll discuss in greater detail. I'll start with our first pillar, relevant experiences. Our relevant and focus categories continues to drive underlying growth in our business, and we've observed a meaningful improvement in our growth relative to the market in every category we've invested to date. Focus categories grew roughly seven points faster than the remainder of our marketplace in Q3.
Year-to-date, our focus categories have grown at approximately 4% year-over-year. For context, we estimate market rates of growth in those same categories were in the low single digits on average during the first half of 2023 as several of these categories are comprised of highly discretionary goods, which have been more acutely impacted by a challenging macro environment. We continue to push the envelope of innovation in motors, parts and accessories, or P&A, by developing features that enhance our customer value proposition.
These investments have fueled mid-single-digit GMV growth for P&A for three consecutive quarters, which is in line with industry growth for this segment of e-commerce in our largest markets. The eBay Guaranteed Fit program has contributed to this momentum by delivering a game-changing level of trust. This program enables tens of millions of P&A shoppers to buy with confidence knowing their auto parts will fit or they'll receive their money back, which has yielded a measurable uplift in conversion.
Additionally, we have not observed a material impact on product returns as our fitment have reduced the likelihood of buyers receiving a part that does not fit their vehicle. Given the success this program has had in the U.S., we were incredibly excited to roll out similar programs in the U.K. and Germany during Q3, where our unaided awareness among P&A shoppers is significantly higher than it is in the U.S. The Guarantee Fit program is underpinned by multiple years of investment in P&A technology, including our acquisition of myFitment.
We have been steadily onboarding sellers into the fitment toolkit to enhance their P&A listings with more robust fitment data, which improves findability for parts and protects buyers from unnecessary returns. By the end of Q3, roughly 2/3 of large U.S. P&A sellers have adopted the toolkit. On average, sellers are observing conversion uplift of double digits or higher for listings enhanced by this toolkit, driving incremental GMV for eBay.
In early October, we reached a major milestone with two billion pieces of fitment data added to live listings using myFitment's technology. While this is outstanding progress, we continue to invest in simplifying the onboarding process, making it faster to import listings and identifying more vehicle matches for our more than 550 million live P&A listings. During Q3, we continued to deliver relevant experiences for the collectibles category across a number of areas. We generated over $10 billion in GMV from collectibles over the last 12 months, and more than one in four eBay buyers purchased at least one collectibles item over the past year.
These buyers carry some of the highest conversion, repurchase and retention rates on eBay. And they are also among the heaviest cross-category shoppers on our platform, which supports our other categories. Our goal is to remain the world's most loved destination for passionate collectibles enthusiasts, providing access to the most compelling assortment of inventory across multiple categories in a high-trust environment. In service of that vision, during Q3, we launched direct submissions to the eBay Vault.
This enables any U.S. resident to send in trading cards valued at $250 or higher from their personal collections to the Vault, even if they were not purchased on eBay. In July to coincide with the National Sports Collectors Convention the industry's biggest event, we announced Vault Enhanced submission, which now enables us to gather large amounts of high-ASP cards in person at tentpole events attended by top collectors. During one weekend at the National Loan, we added tens of millions of dollars of assets under management at eBay Vault, including a signed Jackie Robinson card valued at approximately $1 million.
During Q3, we also wrote out a revamped condition grading system for trading cards, which greatly improves transparency for collectibles in this category. New listings now carry more precise details, including whether a card has been professionally graded and the numerical grade or one of several predefined card conditions. Existing listings will be also migrated to the new standard over the coming months. Sellers have been asking us for this feature for some time, and we believe it will drive improved trust for buyers, better and more consistent price realization for sellers as well as more robust data and insights around individual card values for eBay.
In response to our growing community of collectors and enthusiasts, last year, we introduced eBay Live, an interactive live shopping experience within the eBay app. This feature marries eBay's unique scale with an engaging shopping experience that we believe enthusiasts across the collectibles, luxury and fashion categories are increasingly seeking. Buyers can interact with influential sellers and check out in real time without leaving the stream.
And sellers have loved this tool as they can move items at scale and increase their sales velocity while listing items as fixed price or as extended auctions. eBay Live is currently in beta, but we continue to expand its availability to more sellers and categories. While we've been thoughtful about the pace of onboarding as we fine-tune the beta experience, Q3 market inflection point as we hosted over 1,000 live events saw our million fire tune in and grew GMV from eBay Live by four times quarter-over-quarter.
Now let me turn to the second pillar of our evolved strategy, scalable solutions. We're pleased with the progress we're making with our eBay International Shipping program, or EIS, which makes cross-border trade more seamless and cost-effective for sellers and buyers. We continued to scale EIS during Q3 and now have over 400 million live listings from U.S. sellers shippable to international buyers in more than 190 countries. Sellers have had an overwhelmingly positive reaction to the new program with customer satisfaction rates approximately 30 points higher than the previous global shipping program it replaced.
In October, we launched combined shipping for EIS, which allows buyers to order multiple items from an international seller and pay one consolidated shipping fee. Q3 also marked another strong quarter for our advertising business. Total advertising revenue grew 24% to $366 million. First-party ads grew 36% to $345 million or 36 points faster than FX-neutral GMV growth. Over 2.3 million sellers adopted a single ad product during Q3, and we currently have over 850 million live Promoted Listings.
Promoted Listing Standard, our cost per acquisition ad unit, was once again the largest contributor to growth in Q3 driven by continued optimization of placements, ad rate improvements and the recurring benefit of the Halo attribution change we discussed last quarter. Promoted Listings Advanced, our cost-per-click product, was the fastest-growing product in our ads portfolio on a year-over-year basis. PL Advanced continues to benefit from the simplifying and automating of core elements of the campaign setup and management processes.
In September, we launched smart targeting for PL Advanced, which makes creating and managing CPC campaigns easier than ever. Previously, these campaigns took a lot of time to set up and manage as sellers have to manually set keywords and manage campaigns individually. Now through smart targeting, eBay uses AI to manage keywords on behalf of sellers and optimize campaigns dynamically, all with just a few clicks to set up. As part of the smart targeting launch, we've also extended CPC ads to the similar items recommendations module when users are viewing another item, using fully automated targeting and bidding technology.
Moving to our third pillar, magical innovations. Last quarter, we discussed our magical listing experience, which represents the biggest transformation of the eBay listing process in our 28-year history. For over two decades, two of our biggest focuses were at odds with each other: making it a simple and fast as possible to list an item and ensuring listings are rich and comprehensive to maximize sales. Now generative AI allows us to leverage our treasure trove of images and listing data to quickly create compelling listings.
Early users have told us these capabilities will unlock more of the inventory in their closets and garages, which could ultimately keep more products out of landfills. The first phase of our magical listing experience leverages generative AI to instantly populate the item description within the listing flow based on a product's title, category and other aspects. This feature rolled out to 100% of mobile app users in the U.S., U.K. and Germany during Q3. In October, we extended the generative AI descriptions to 50% of desktop users in these countries.
The first phase of the magical listing experience has been incredibly well received by sellers as usage, adoption, customer satisfaction and content acceptance rates have all been higher than expected. As much as sellers have enjoyed the first phase of magical listing, we believe the next iteration will be so simple and easy to use that all of our sellers will love it. This experience will enable sellers to point their camera at an item, take a photo, and eBay does the rest. Behind the scenes, we have powered this experience with our proprietary computer vision technology and generative AI to seamlessly populate the description, category and any other item aspects.
Our camera-based magical listing experience has been in employee beta for several months and is currently in a limited beta with a number of large sellers. Feedback from our beta sellers has been extremely positive as they found the new experience intuitive and easier to use. We are incredibly excited to bring this experience to more sellers over the coming months. As part of our magical listing initiative, we also rolled out a vastly improved background removal tool powered by AI during Q3. Sellers have told us that simpler, cleaner images of their products have a significant impact on conversion.
Our enhanced tool has now rolled out to all users in the core listing flow, and sellers have told us they are already noticing significant quality and performance improvements from the revamped tool versus our prior version. Overall, I'm incredibly pleased by the progress we are making across all three pillars of our strategy. It is particularly encouraging to see how recent advancements in AI and machine learning can help us address more long-standing pain points for sellers and buyers on eBay in efficient and scalable ways. Next, I'd like to highlight the impact we're having on the communities we serve.
In Q3, we released our second annual small business report, which examines the sentiment of our global sellers. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, eBay sellers are confident they can build their businesses and give back to their communities. In fact, more than half of eBay sellers expect their overall business to grow in the next 12 months, and over 2/3 expect their businesses on eBay to increase over the next five years. We also recently announced the winners of our up-and-running grants.
This program is currently in its fourth year and provides entrepreneurs with capital to invest in their businesses, along with training and mentorship to help them grow and thrive. The third quarter also marked the 20th anniversary of eBay for Charity, a program created as a way for people to give back during times of crisis. It has evolved to a global platform supporting countless organizations and causes and raised more than $1.3 billion for nonprofits to date. In Q3 alone, the eBay community raised $40 million, up 16% year-over-year.
All of these efforts demonstrate our purpose-driven community, and we are honored to be recognized for our progress. We're proud to be ranked on the U.S. News & World Report's inaugural list of Best Companies to Work For. eBay was also recognized as a top corporate philanthropist by the Silicon Valley Business Journal and San Francisco Business Times. In closing, I'd like to thank our extraordinary eBay team for delivering another solid quarter and continuing to innovate for our customers.
We made significant progress against our long-term objectives during Q3. Our accelerating pace of innovation is fundamentally changing the eBay experience, driving higher customer satisfaction and paving the way for new growth and revenue opportunities. As the macro environment remains uncertain, we'll be balanced in how we invest in the future, prioritizing our highest-ROI investments in order to generate long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.

Steve Priest
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at eBay
Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with highlights on the third quarter on slide 11 of our earnings presentation. Next, I'll discuss our key financial and operating metrics in greater detail. Finally, I'll provide our outlook for the fourth quarter and some closing thoughts before we begin Q&A. As usual, my comments will reflect year-over-year comparisons on an organic FX-neutral basis, unless I note otherwise.
Q3 was another solid quarter for eBay as we met or exceeded expectations across all of our key financial metrics despite ongoing uncertainty in the global economy. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% to approximately $18 billion. Revenue grew 4% to $2.5 billion, outpacing volume by five points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.4%. We delivered $1.03 of non-GAAP earnings per share, and we generated $777 million of free cash flow while returning $783 million to shareholders through repurchasing dividends.
Let's take a closer look at our financial performance during the third quarter. Gross merchandise volume was down 1% organically to approximately $18 billion or roughly flat year-over-year on a total FX-neutral basis. Foreign exchange represented a nearly 2-point tailwind to reported GMV growth. However, the U.S. dollar appreciation during the quarter created a GMV headwind of more than $100 million versus rates implied in our Q3 outlook. Focus categories continue to drive underlying momentum in our business, growing roughly seven points faster than the remainder of our marketplace.
P&A was once again the largest contributor to growth and maintained mid-single-digit GMV growth for the third straight quarter, in line with market rate of growth for this segment of e-commerce. eBay Refurbished was the fastest-growing focus category on a percentage basis, while GMV growth in our luxury focus categories was positive for the third straight quarter as our combination of value and quality has served customers well in the current economic environment. Next, I'll walk through our results on a geographic basis. U.S. GMV was down 2% organically in Q3, an improvement of over two points sequentially.
On a total FX-neutral basis, U.S. GMV was down 1%. Although the U.S. economy has been more resilient than our other markets, demand for discretionary goods continues to be impacted by the cumulative burden of elevated inflation and the highest interest rates observed in over a decade. U.S. consumers are increasingly seeking value, which has shifted some demand to inventory offered by our CBT sellers. International GMV was roughly flat on an FX-neutral basis and up nearly 4% as reported.
Our international markets continue to experience more severe macroeconomic pressure than the U.S. with the U.K. seeing consistently negative e-commerce growth since early 2022, while Germany has now faced multiple quarters of economic contraction. This pressure has been mitigated by continued strength in cross-border trade, which offset far weaker trends in Europe. Moving to buyers. Trailing 12-month active buyers was stable quarter-over-quarter at 132 million. On an organic basis, active buyers remained at approximately 131 million for the third straight quarter. Confused spite also flat sequentially at 16 million.
Spend points was stable quarter-over-quarter at around $3,000 annually but modestly year-over-year. Turning to revenue. We generated revenue of $2.5 billion during the third quarter, up 4% organically, outpacing volume by five points. Total FX-neutral revenue growth inclusive of M&A was 5%, while currency had a de minimis impact to reported growth. Our take rate was 13.9%, down modestly quarter-over-quarter but up nearly 50 basis points year-over-year.
The combination of FX and the ad revenue recognition change in Q2 represented a sequential take rate headwind of over 10 basis points in Q3. Advertising was again the largest tailwind to our take rate on a year-over-year basis and also quarter-over-quarter after adjusting for the Q2 accounting change. eBay International Shipping and recent M&A in aggregate added five basis points to our take rate sequentially. Total advertising revenue grew 24% to $366 million and reached just over 2% penetration of GMV.
First-party ads grew 36% to $345 million or roughly 36 points faster than FX-neutral volume. As noted last quarter, the revenue deferral release for CPC ads in Q2 created a sequential headwind of $9 million for first-party ad revenue growth in Q3. While we are pleased with the continued robust growth in Promoted Listings, year-over-year growth decelerated slightly as we lack the notable acceleration during the prior year period, which was driven by a series of performance optimizations.
Our legacy third-party display ads, which have been impacted by a combination of secular and macro headwinds in recent quarters, decelerated further during Q3. In recent months, we have actively deprecated third-party ads in certain circumstances to improve the user experience. First-party ads remain our primary focus as we continue to invest in scaling, optimizing and automating our Promoted Listings portfolio. Financial services had a modestly positive impact on our take rate sequentially as our in-house payments capabilities have advanced in recent quarters.
We have identified more opportunities for GMV, revenue and cost optimization. Adyen continues to be an incredibly strategic partner for us in financial services. During Q3, we expanded our usage of Adyen's merchant acquiring services to cover additional forms of payment. This development has positive implications for our Adyen model probability, which I will discuss shortly. Moving to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.4% during the quarter, down roughly 2.5 points year-over-year.
Roughly 1.1 points of this delta was driven by the combination of recent M&A and the eBay International Shipping program. Foreign exchange also represents a year-over-year headwind of approximately 40 basis points. The remainder of the margin variance was driven by investments in our business and modest volume deleverage. Gross margin was down nearly 90 basis points year-over-year primarily from the ramp of eBay International Shipping.
Within our operating expenses, we observed a 1-point increase in product development expense as we invested in product and engineering talent to drive innovation across eBay. Sales and marketing was down modestly as a percentage of revenue year-over-year in Q3 as our investments in full-funnel marketing initiatives were offset by cost efficiencies, including lower spend on coupons and incentives. During the quarter, we also accrued an additional $50 million to G&A expense on a GAAP basis related to pending legal matters.
This adjustment is reflected in our non-GAAP reconciliations, while additional details on the accrual will be provided in our 10-Q filing. We continue to focus on driving expenses out of the business, which is a crucial part of our path to long-term sustainable growth. And where we do choose to invest, we are able to partially offset that with opex savings driven by our structural cost program. Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of $777 million in Q3, up 23%.
Our balance sheet position remains robust as we ended the quarter with cash and non-equity investments of $5.4 billion and gross debt of $7.7 billion. We repurchased over $650 million of eBay shares at an average price of approximately $44 during Q3 and had $1.7 billion remaining under our current buyback authorization at the quarter end. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $132 million in September or $0.25 per share. Since the beginning of 2022, we have returned nearly $5.2 billion to shareholders through repurchasing dividends of roughly 125% of cumulative free cash flow over that period.
We generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 in Q3, up 3% year-over-year, benefiting from a nearly 4% reduction in share count from our repurchase. We delivered GAAP earnings per share of $2.46 with the delta driven by unrealized gains on our equity investment portfolio primarily from Adevinta. Our investment portfolio is detailed on slide 21 of our earnings presentation. Our major equity investments and warrants were valued over $4.5 billion at the end of Q3. Our 404 million Adevinta shares were valued at roughly $4 billion at more than $1 billion versus the prior quarter.
As we disclosed in late September, we have expressed support for the proposal made by the consortium of investors to Adevinta, under which we would retain a portion of our current holdings. As these discussions are ongoing, we are not in a position to provide any further comments on this transaction or the implications of such a transaction to eBay today. Our Adyen warrants were valued at nearly $200 million at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, our warrant value is calculated based on several assumptions, including adding share price and the probability of our remaining warrant tranches vesting.
During Q3, the probability of vesting was positively impacted by an evolution on our usage of Adyen's products and services. The three remaining warrant tranches now carry probabilities ranging between 0% and 95%. However, the increase in probability was more than offset by a price decline in Adyen shares during the third quarter. Moving on to our outlook. Although our third quarter volume trends were slightly better than expected, we did observe softening consumer demand in September that carried through October.
This macro softness was most pronounced in Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, our second and third largest markets, respectively. We have also seen tapering demand in the U.S. market quarter-to-date. Given these trends, our base-case expectation is a continued pressure on discretionary demand will lead to a relatively muted seasonal uptick in volumes during the holiday season. For the fourth quarter, we expect to generate between $17.9 billion and $18.3 billion of GMV, representing an organic FX-neutral decline of between 4% and 2% year-over-year or spot growth between negative 2% and flat.
The strength in U.S. dollar also creates an incremental FX headwind to fourth quarter GMV of roughly $400 million versus our prior guidance on a spot basis. This is on top of more than $100 million FX headwind to Q3 GMV. On a sequential basis, we estimate FX will represent over a 1-point headwind to GMV growth and nearly one point of pressure to revenue growth. We anticipate Q4 revenue between $2.47 billion and $2.53 billion represents organic FX-neutral growth between negative 1% and positive 2% year-over-year.
This implies revenue will outpace volume by three to four points on an organic FX-neutral basis in Q4. As a reminder, our core take rate is typically down sequentially by 10 to 15 basis points in Q4 due to seasonal ASP and category mix, although this trend has occasionally been masked by payments and ads growth in the recent past. Given our tempered outlook for Q4 volume and continued uncertainty in the global economy, we believe it is prudent to lean in more heavily into cost efficiencies to protect margins and earnings in this environment.
We forecast non-GAAP operating margin between 26.1% and 26.7% during Q4, which would yield margins to the high end of our prior guidance range for the full year. We forecast non-GAAP earnings per share between $1 and $1.05, representing EPS growth between negative 6% and negative 2% year-over-year. At current rates, FX would represent a 4-point headwind to year-over-year EPS growth in Q4 as we lap meaningful hedging gains in the prior year period. Our outlook for free cash flow of just under $2 billion this year remains unchanged.
As I noted last quarter, we expect de minimis free cash flow in Q4 due to the delayed timing of cash tax payments in 2023. Our capital expenditures for the full year are expected between 4% and 5%, while our non-GAAP tax rate should remain unchanged at 16.5%. In relation to 2024, it is premature to offer specific commentary as we are in the midst of our planning process. We remain committed to find an appropriate balance between growth and profitability to ensure we are positioned to durable financial returns in the years ahead.
As such, we plan to grow expenses more slowly than revenue next year as we scale and leverage the investments we've made over the last few years. We will remain good stewards of capital as we continue to target returning 125% of cumulative free cash flow to shareholders through repurchases and dividends through 2024. We will target a certain level of capital returns from quarter-to-quarter while maintaining the flexibility to lean in opportunistically when appropriate.
In closing, our Q3 results highlight the resilience of our marketplace and business model amid continued challenges in the global economy. Our fortress balance sheet and operational discipline have enabled us to adapt to rapidly evolving demand environment while continuing to invest for the future, protecting earnings and delivering meaningful capital return to shareholders. I'm extremely proud of our teams for staying focused on our strategic pillars amid this uncertainty and further laying the groundwork for long-term sustainable growth.
With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions."
8,Target,Q3,"Brian Cornell
Chair and Chief Executive Officer at Target
Thanks, John. For many years now, we have focused on building a durable business model, that allows us to meet guests where they are, developing and enhancing the right tools and capabilities, while investing heavily in our team, all in the service of providing an affordable, easy and joyful guest experience. And the flexibility of our multi-category model has served us incredibly well over the last few years, delivering unprecedented growth in both traffic and sales. Today, our business generates well over $100 billion in annual revenue, and is successfully navigating through a very challenging environment, as consumers continue to rebalance their spending between goods and experiences and make tough choices in the face of persistent inflation.
Even as our P&L is being impacted by multiple topline and bottom-line challenges, including soft industry trends in discretionary categories, moderating inflation rates in Essentials and Food and Beverage, and higher inventory shrink, we've seen a meaningful improvement in profitability compared with last year, more specifically, our EPS through the first three quarters of 2023 with more than 40% higher than last year and more than 26% higher than in 2019. Importantly, even beyond this year's rapid progress, we believe we have a significant opportunity to grow both the topline and bottom-line in the years ahead. So, even as we remain cautious in our near-term outlook, we're not standing still. We're playing the long game, investing in our stores, our supply chain, our team, our digital capabilities and our assortment, to provide the newness, value and convenience our guests want for this holiday season and beyond. At the heart of it all is our focus on being our guests happy place and delivering the joyful shopping experience that makes Target target.
In the third quarter, Target's comparable sales were down 4.9%, in line with our expectations. Consistent with prior quarters and overall industry trends, discretionary categories were the driver of this decline, partially offset by net sales growth in our frequency categories. Between sales channels, store comp trends were somewhat stronger than in the digital channel. Among our digital fulfillment capabilities, same-day services saw high-single-digit comp growth, led by Drive-Up, which expanded 12%. Strength in these services was offset by continued softness in brown box delivery, which is most affected by the pullback in discretionary categories.
On the bottom-line. Our third quarter EPS of $2.10 was well above our expectations, and more than 36% ahead of last year. This increase reflected the continued benefit of lower freight costs, disciplined inventory management by our team, favorable category and channel mix and the continued benefit of our work to enhance efficiency, which offset multiple pressures throughout our business. This is outstanding profit performance in the face of a very challenging environment, and I want to thank our entire team for their tireless efforts in support of our guests, our business and each other.
As you know, one of our top priorities this year was the rebuild our profitability, following unique challenges we faced in 2022. And while there's lots more work ahead of us, I'm really pleased with the progress the team has delivered so far this year. At the same time, I want to make it clear, we are not satisfied with the topline trends we've been seeing. Our number one priority is to get back to sustainable growth in both traffic and sales, and we're committed to investing in long-term initiatives to deliver this growth. As we assess the external environment, it's clear that consumers have been remarkably resilient. Yet at the same time, our research indicates that themes like uncertainty, caution, managing my time and budget and focusing on essentials, while still finding ways to celebrate, are all top-of-mind. Overall, consumers are still spending, but pressures like higher interest rates, resumption of student loan repayments, increased credit card debt and reduce savings rates have left them with less discretionary income, forcing them to make trade-offs and their family budgets.
For example, this year, we've seen more and more consumers delaying their spending until the last moment. Guests, who previously bought sweat shirts or denim in August or September, are deciding to wait until the weather turns cold before making a purchase. This is a clear indication of the pressures they're facing, as they work to stretch their budgets until the next paycheck.
Consistent with these pressures, as we look at recent trends across the retail industry, dollar sales are being driven by higher prices, with consumers buying fewer units per trip. In fact, overall unit demand across the industry has been down 2% to 4% in recent quarters, and the industry has experienced seven consecutive quarters of declines in discretionary dollars and units. And while we're happy to see inflation rates moderating this year, if you compare, industry pricing in key categories back to 2020, food at home pricing for families has increased 25% overall, and in some areas, up to 30%. And if you're a parent raising a baby, you're facing increases of more than 30% on baby food and formula too. And that's in addition to persistent increases in a variety of other categories. So, when you layer on the impact of higher energy prices, it all puts pressure on discretionary spending. As a result, this holiday season, we're focusing on highlighting the amazing value we've always provided in our end caps, promotions and the price points we feature in our marketing.
As we built our plans for this holiday season, we maintain our cautious inventory positioning in markdown sensitive categories. This provides our team the necessary flexibility to quickly adjust to volatile trends, something that has served us well all year. But I want to be crystal clear, that does not mean we're backing off on newness. While we're cautious about the size of our inventory commitments, we're leaning into the amount of innovation featured in our assortment. And after several years, in which our vendors, were focused on raising production volumes in the face of unprecedented demand, we're encouraged by the focus on newness and innovation we're seeing from them. And as I've mentioned, throughout this holiday season, we'll be focused on highlighting value, helping families to celebrate the joy of the season in a way that fits their budget.
Beyond our assortment, as we work to provide a great guest experience, we've enhanced our training of retail fundamentals for our teams. This is an important shift after years of operating in an environment, there was anything but normal. After all, given the large number of team members we've hired over the last few years, a meaningful number of them have never experienced ordinary sales trends. As we've said many times, investments in our team are the most important ones we make. And today, we remain on our front foot, investing to ensure they can deliver a joyful industry-leading shopping experience. This holiday season, we'll be supplementing our existing team by hiring nearly 100,000 seasonal team members to meet expected demand and ensure we can deliver a joyful shopping experience.
So now, as I get ready to hand the call over to Christina, I think it would be useful to pause and assess how this year has progressed in comparison to our expectations. As a reminder, at the beginning of this year, we said we were expecting a challenging environment, with the sales guidance range centered around flat comparable sales. In terms of profitability, we said we expect to grow our full-year operating income by $1 billion or more, with an expected EPS range of $7.75 to $8.75. So, today, with three quarters of the year behind us, top-line trends have obviously been tougher than expected and we're firmly focused on getting back to growth.
But the story on profitability has been very different. Through the first three quarters of this year, we've already grown operating income by more than $1 billion compared with last year, despite unexpected headwinds from higher-than-expected shrink and softer-than-expected sales. We're encouraged with this performance against a challenging backdrop, which demonstrates the resilience of both our team and our business. I'm incredibly proud to be a member of this great team and excited about the growth we're positioned to deliver in the years ahead.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Christina.

Christina Hennington
Executive Vice President and Chief Growth Officer at Target
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As we've shared for the past several quarters now, even as our guests face tough choices as they manage their budgets, they are also continuing to celebrate seasonal moments, while showing their excitement for new product offerings and compelling value. After all, consumers are feeling the weight of multiple economic pressures and discretionary retail has borne the brunt of this wait for many quarters now.
In addition, consumers are facing newly emerging headwinds, including higher interest rates and the return of student loan payments. In the face of this mental and emotional tug-of-war, consumers are looking for a respite, which is why we are relentless in our pursuit to provide ease, inspiration, joy and comprehensive value, everyday. And while we are not satisfied with our current performance, I am confident that our teams' empathy and their continued focus on serving our guests wants and needs, will pay dividends in the years ahead.
As Brian mentioned, our third quarter comparable sales decline reflected continued softness in discretionary categories, partially offset by growth in Beauty, notably comps within frequency categories slowed between Q2 and Q3, driven entirely by a deceleration in the comp benefit from growth in average retail. More specifically, in both Food and Beverage and Beauty and Essentials, the benefit from average pricing decelerated by about 3 percentage points between the second and third quarters, as we move beyond the period of peak inflation from a year ago. As we said, a lower inflation rate is welcome news as it will reduce pressure on consumer budgets, making room for them to expand back into discretionary categories over time.
Beauty-led performance in the quarter, with comparable sales growth in the high-single-digits, driven by strength across core Beauty and our Ulta Beauty at Target offerings. We're excited to launch Fenty Beauty by Rihanna in the third quarter, and it has quickly become one of our top-selling beauty brands across the chain. In Food and Beverage, comp sales were down slightly to last year. Seasonal candy, snacks and hosting solutions performed particularly well. Comp sales in Essentials decline in the low-single-digits, despite strength in healthcare and baby categories. Comp sales in our discretionary categories remained soft in the third quarter, with declines ranging from the high-single-digits to low-double-digits. However, trends improved markedly compared with the second quarter, thanks to the agility of our team and their focus on listening and responding to our guests.
Homes saw high-single-digit comp decline, an improvement of more than 6 percentage points from the second quarter. Most notably, we saw strength in back-to-school and college categories and a great response to our assortment of Stanley drinkware. Additionally, within kitchenware, we launched our most recent owned brand, Figmint, and received an enthusiastic response from our guests. Figmint offers more than 250 items, ranging from enamel cookware to ceramic mixing bowls to kitchen gadgets, all at a quality, esthetic and value that can't be tapped.
Apparel comparable sales also declined high-single-digits, an improvement of nearly 3 percentage points when compared with Q2. The business was strongest within new offerings, including our partnership with Kendra Scott jewelry, the latest All in Motion performance wear, and new fall fashion sets within our women's categories. Hardlines comparable sales were down in the low-teens. While we were encouraged by back-to-school performance, demand for electronics remains particularly soft. This quarter's performance demonstrates that while the results are not immune to macro conditions, when we focus on retail fundamentals, offer exciting new products and incredible value and respond to our guests wants and needs in a timely manner, we remain relevant with our guests, even against the challenging backdrop.
By leaning into seasonal moments like back-to-school, back-to-college and Halloween, we not only drove sales in the current quarter, we helped to build lasting affinity with our guests. This focus on celebrating the season creates an engaging experience that keeps Target top-of-mind. And that's why we continue to offer events like our latest Target Circle Week in early October, which added another 500,000 members to our loyalty platform, providing future opportunities to engage with these guests in deeper ways.
Our goal this holiday season is to create the perfect combination of incredible value, inspiring and fresh products and a joyful shopping experience as you stroll the aisles in our stores or on the recently refreshed Target website and app. We aim to deepen the relationships with our guests, as they look to deck the halls and celebrate the joys that the holidays bring. As we do year round, we are leaning into the power of and this holiday season by not focusing only on one aspect of our strategy, but celebrating how they all work together to create a unique offering in a crowded retail landscape. Our plans start with a celebratory experience that you feel the moment you walk into our stores or open the Target website or app, featuring on-trend and inspiring color pallets, imagery and in-store marketing that complements all the excitement and joy we are creating with our national marketing campaigns.
Guests will feel the holiday spirit before they even add the first item to the cart. The excitement builds with our assortment at unbeatable value only at Target exclusive merchandise and our easy and convenient holiday solutions. And through it all, we will remain diligent on executing the necessary retail fundamentals our guests want and expect from us, including being in-stock on a must-have items of the season, offering unmatched value and pricing, highlighting our inspiring and differentiated merchandise assortment and making each trip easy and convenient, regardless of where, when and how guests chooses to shop.
Whether a guest knows exactly what they are looking for or needs a bit of inspiration, we want to make the trip joyful, easy and welcoming. And we know families want to celebrate the holidays, but they're relying on us to help them do so affordably, with a combination of everyday low prices, compelling promotions and exciting savings events all season long. We aim to be the holiday destination for affordable joy.

I'm so inspired by how each of our teams from marketing to merchandising to stores to supply chain are bringing their best to create something truly magical and uniquely target this holiday season. I want to thank the entire Target team around the world for being the not-so-secret weapon that will help us to win the holiday season.
As I get ready to end my remarks, John, I want to pause and thank you and acknowledge your countless contributions to the Target brand and team. I've greatly appreciated getting to work alongside you for so many years, and know your legacy will be felt for many more.
With that, I'll turn the call over to you.

John J. Mulligan
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at Target
Thanks, Christina. Over the last 3.5 years, our operations have continually faced unusual and rapidly changing external conditions. In 2020 and 2021, after the onset of the pandemic, we couldn't secure enough inventory to satisfy the explosion in demand for our products and we saw operating margin rates grow well beyond normal levels. Then, in early 2022, the period of rapid growth in discretionary categories suddenly reversed, and we quickly moved from having too little inventory to having way too much. As a result, both our distribution centers and store backrooms filled up well beyond optimal levels and operating margin rates quickly moved to historical lows.
So, this year, as Brian mentioned, a key priority was to optimize our inventory position, so it was better aligned to the current size and growth rate of our business. We were confident that if we were successful in that effort, our operations will become more efficient, markdowns will come back down and we'd see our profit rate recover back toward more sustainable long-term levels. And through the first three quarters of the year, despite unexpectedly soft top-line trends, the team has delivered a more rapid recovery in our profitability than we'd even planned at the beginning of the year.
Looking ahead, we've maintained this cautious inventory posture and planning for the fourth quarter as well. More specifically, at the end of the third quarter, total inventory on our balance sheet was 14% lower than a year ago, with discretionary category inventory down 19%. And, importantly, while this ending inventory position was 29% higher than at the end of Q3 2019, that's aligned with growth we've seen on the sales line over those four years, making us feel really good about both the size and the health of our inventory position as we enter the holiday season.
In addition, even though we own a lot less inventory than a year ago, the team has delivered meaningfully improved reliability and in-stock metrics this year, and they made additional progress in Q3. More specifically, overall in-stocks in the third quarter improved nearly 1 percentage point compared with Q2 and more than 3 percentage points from a year ago. And notably, in-stocks in our highest volume stores saw an even greater year-over-year improvement. In terms of our top-selling items, while the in-stock rate remained consistent between Q2 and Q3, that was after we grew the size of that list by about 75%, meaning that today, our top item list accounts for more than one-third of our total sales.
Beyond these broader metrics, we also saw meaningful improvements in our seasonal in-stocks and a more than 6 percentage point improvement in new item in-stocks. In our smaller stores, which on average have less shelf capacity and turn faster than the chain, in-stocks have improved by more than 2 percentage points between the first and third quarters. And today, our in-stock levels in those stores are slightly better than the overall chain. And finally, in the digital channel, the percent of items available for purchase has improved by more than 2 points compared with last year, reflecting an improvement of nearly 8 percentage points in apparel. Beyond the work of our teams to deliver these outstanding improvements, we're benefiting from a more than two-week reduction of import lead times compared with last year and a nearly 10 percentage point improvement in purchase order fill rates compared with a year ago. And with the combined benefit of a faster supply chain and a simultaneous reduction in inventory levels, all of our supply chain facilities stayed at or below our desired capacity thresholds through all 13 weeks of the third quarter this year compared with only three of 13 weeks in Q3 of 2022.
So, while we'll continue to focus on ways to consistently deliver higher in-stocks and reliability, I'm incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished so far this year.
So now, before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to highlight how our team continues to deliver on their efforts to improve execution of everyday retail fundamentals as we prepare for the busiest shopping season of the year. One of the key areas of focus for our store teams this year was to ensure priority items remained available on our sales floors throughout the day. And this year, through these efforts, we've increased the amount of inventory available on our sales floors by more than $0.75 billion [Phonetic].
In addition, we've seen improvements in metrics relating to backroom inventory accuracy and the percent of new assortments set on time. In the digital channel, the percentage of orders picked and shipped on time and the average Drive-Up wait time have all improved from last year. Also in support of the digital business, the percent of items ordered, but not found, has declined from a year ago, meaning that we are fulfilling more items per order and canceling fewer, a key factor in guest satisfaction.
Since our goal is for Target to be the easiest place for our guests to shop, our teams have been focused on the front of store experience, with the goal of providing consistently great service through the in-store checkout experience, along with Drive-Up and in-store pickup. And because our guests tell us they enjoy interacting with our team, since we've refocused on the front-end experience, we've seen more than a 6 percentage point increase in the usage of full service lanes across the chain. And we've seen sustained month-over-month improvement in the Net Promoter Score relating to interactions with our team at checkout. In addition, compared with last year, we've seen improvements in Net Promoter Scores for both Drive-Up and in-store pickup on top of already high levels a year ago.
Beyond the front of store, in support of our efforts to highlight value and affordability, our team has been working to increase the number of store end caps featuring one or two price points. As a result, going into this holiday season, nearly two-thirds of our end caps were meeting the standard and conveying a simple, compelling and easy-to-understand value message.
Finally, I want to provide a quick update on our goal of hiring 100,000 seasonal team members to join our team and provide a great guest experience during the holiday season. I'm happy to report that our hiring stats this year have improved relative to last year. I'm confident our entire team will be energized and ready to support our guests throughout the busiest season of the year.
So now, as I get ready to turn the call over to Michael, I want to quickly thank all of you for your continued interest and engagement with Target. I've been fortunate to meet and interact with many of you over the years, beginning with my time as CFO and continuing with my time leading operations. I also want to say to the entire Target team, thank you for everything I've learned from you, for your enduring passion for retail and for your love of this iconic brand. I'll continue to be a huge supporter of this Company and this team when I'm no longer on these calls. Because of all of you, I know that the Company and our guests are in very good hands, and I'll be cheering on your efforts from the sidelines.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Michael.

Michael Fiddelke
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Target
Thanks, John. Before I begin my formal remarks, I want to thank you for the positive impact you've made on this Company, our strategy, our team and on me personally. I've been fortunate to work with you and learn from you since I first arrived at Target 20 years ago.
In the third quarter, total revenue was down 4.2%, reflecting a 4.3% decline in total sales and a 0.6% decline in other revenue. Within the other revenue line, declines in credit card revenue and a few smaller items were nearly offset by growth in Roundel ad revenue. Among the drivers of our third quarter comparable sales, traffic was down 4.1%, combined with a 0.8% decrease in average ticket. While we're encouraged that our Q3 comp trend improved 0.5 point compared with Q2 and the traffic trend recovered a little bit faster, we're not at all satisfied with this result, and we're laser-focused on moving both traffic and sales trends back into positive territory.
As Christina mentioned, our guests continue to shop around seasonal moments. So, not surprisingly, Q3 comp performance was strongest around the back-to-school and back-to-college seasons. For the remainder of the quarter, we saw variability week by week, with periods of relative strength around promotions.
Our third quarter gross margin rate of 27.4% was more than 2.5 points better than last year, driven by multiple benefits within merchandising, including meaningfully lower freight costs and favorable clearance markdowns. In addition, we benefited from year-over-year favorability in digital fulfillment and supply chain costs. And perhaps, surprisingly, merchandise mix drove a small rate benefit compared with last year as we continue to benefit from growth in higher-margin categories like Beauty and we saw the softest performance in very low-margin categories like electronics. Partially offsetting these tailwinds, the rising cost of inventory shrink represented a 40 basis point headwind to our third quarter gross margin rate. While we're encouraged that this impact was smaller than expected and better than we faced earlier in the year, growth in shrink remains a significant financial headwind and we're determined to continue making progress in the years ahead.
While our Q3 guidance anticipated significant improvement in our gross margin rate, our actual performance was well above our expectations as the team delivered greater-than-expected progress on several fronts. At the top of that list is their continued agility in managing inventory, which delivered compelling benefits on both the gross margin and SG&A expense lines. In addition, our teams' ongoing efforts to identify long-term efficiency opportunities is already contributing to this quarter's better-than-expected performance. Beyond those drivers, a couple of macro factors came in better than expected, including freight costs and the impact of inventory shrink.
On the SG&A line, our third quarter rate of 20.9% was just over 1 percentage point higher than last year. This growth reflected cost increases throughout our business, including continued investments in our team, along with the deleveraging impact of lower sales, partially offset by disciplined cost management throughout the organization. Our Q3 depreciation and amortization expense rate of 2.4% was about 10 basis points higher than a year ago, reflecting dollar growth of about 3%.
Altogether, our third quarter operating margin rate of 5.2% was more than 1 percentage point higher than last year. And notably, this year's rate was only about 20 basis points lower than the 5.4% our business delivered prior to the pandemic in the third quarter of 2019 despite the cumulative 110 basis point drag from shrink we faced since then. Also important, given the growth in revenue that our team has delivered over that four-year period, this year's Q3 operating margin dollars were more than 30% higher than in 2019. As a result, on the bottom-line, both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 in this year's third quarter were more than 36% ahead of last year and more than 50% higher than in 2019.
Important to note, while the backdrop today remains tough, because of the long-term investments we continue to make and the efforts of our team to identify efficiency opportunities throughout our business, we have a lot more opportunity to grow both our top-line and increase our profitability in the years ahead. And our team is already delivering strong profit performance, both compared to a year ago and versus our longer-term history as well.
Now, I'll turn to capital deployment and reiterate our priorities which have remained consistent for decades. We first look to fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then, we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual increases, which we've maintained for more than 50 years. And finally, we deploy any excess cash within the limits of our middle A credit ratings through share repurchase over time.
Regarding the first priority, capital investment through the first three quarters of the year was just under $4 billion, and we expect full year capex will be near the high end of the $4 billion to $5 billion range we laid out for the year. While we're still in the early stages of developing next year's capital plan, our current expectation is that next year's capex will be somewhat lower than this year in the $3 billion to $4 billion range, reflecting our current view of the optimal timing for key investments we're planning over the next several years.
Regarding our second capital priority, we paid dividends of just over $0.5 billion in Q3, $10 million higher than last year, reflecting a per share dividend increase of 1.9%.
Regarding the last priority, we didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter as we continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and restoring our debt metrics to levels that support our middle A credit ratings, and we continue to make meaningful progress on that journey, as the combined benefits of higher profits and lower working capital have led a meaningful improvement in operating cash flow. More specifically, our operations have generated more than $5.3 billion in cash through the first three quarters of the year, up dramatically from about $550 million through the first three quarters of 2022.
As always, I'll conclude my review of the quarter with our trailing 12-month after tax ROIC, which was 13.9% in the third quarter, down from 14.6% a year ago. While an after tax return in the low-teens is quite healthy in absolute terms, it's meaningfully lower than the returns we expect to deliver over time. Importantly, we've seen sequential improvement in this metric over the last couple of quarters and we're focused on continuing that momentum in the years ahead.
Now, I'll turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter. On the top-line, our expectations reflect our continued near-term caution, leading us to maintain our prior guidance for a mid-single-digit decline in Q4 comparable sales. On the bottom-line, we're also maintaining a cautious posture, particularly because the fourth quarter is typically a very promotional season. As such, we're planning a wide range for our fourth quarter EPS of $1.90 to $2.60, which represents approximately flat growth to last year on the low end and growth of about 37% on the high end.
I also want to note that 2023 is a 53-week year. So, the fourth quarter will include an extra week of sales and profits. We estimate that extra week will add about $1.7 billion in sales and result in about 30 basis points of operating margin rate leverage on the quarter. Note that it will not affect our comparable sales as we base that calculation on periods of equal length.
On top of the results, our team has already delivered through Q3, our fourth quarter guidance implies a full year EPS range that's very close to the original guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year, with a midpoint less than $0.05 from the center of the original range. That's an amazing outcome against the backdrop of a tougher-than-expected top-line and it's a testament to the tireless efforts of our team to stay nimble and successfully navigate through a volatile and unpredictable period. In fact, given how strong our profit rate performance has been so far this year, we've been getting some questions about whether we're only focused on increasing our profit rate, and I want to pause and address that question head on.
As John mentioned earlier, coming into this year, we were confident our team would deliver a significant increase in our profit rate by achieving better alignment between our inventory and our sales. In addition, a year ago, we first talked about the significant long-term efficiency opportunities we're pursuing, given that we've grown our revenue to more than $100 billion per year. While that work is still in its early stages, the team has already delivered hundreds of millions of dollars of efficiency savings so far this year, significantly benefiting our profitability.
But I want to make it clear, we are focused on growing profit dollars. And if we saw an opportunity to invest a portion of our current profit rate to gain sustainable long-term growth in dollars, we would gladly do that. Even more fundamentally, our first priority is to deliver long-term top-line growth, because the only way a retailer can sustainably deliver bottom-line growth is by delivering top-line growth as well. At the same time, we're not interested in making any investments that might boost the top-line in the short term, but which wouldn't lead to any sustainable growth. In fact, our experience has shown that many times, those kinds of short-term decisions are actually harmful over time.
So, today, we remain focused on the long-term strategies that have been so successful in driving top-line growth over the last half decade, including our work to enhance our assortment of both owned brands and national brands, our investments in our store assets and our team to deliver a reliable and differentiated shopping experience, investments in new stores and markets we've not previously served and in existing stores to keep them fresh and enhancing our digital experience, beginning with the website and Target app, all the way through to the fulfillment services we provide.
As we pursue those long-term initiatives, we also have opportunity to further grow our operating margin rate in the years ahead, and we don't believe those efforts are incompatible with each other. But more directly, based on where we are today, we believe we can successfully deliver both top-line growth and rate improvement over time.
And as always, the basis for my confidence starts and ends with the Target team. They have delivered unprecedented growth over the last several years. And this year, they've made amazing progress in moving our profitability back toward the optimal level, all while focusing on building and maintaining long-term relationships with our guests. Our team is truly the best team in retail.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Brian.

Brian Cornell
Chair and Chief Executive Officer at Target
Thanks, Michael. Before we turn to your questions, I want to pause and acknowledge John's incredible record of service to Target and thank him for his profound impact he's had on this Company. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I'm not planning to recap his entire 27th-year career this morning, but I do want to highlight the impact he's had since I arrived in 2014, an impact that literally began on my first day when John handed me a large binder, a recap of the comprehensive strategy review he and the Board conducted during his time as interim CEO.
That body of work was an invaluable resource, that allowed me to hit the ground running. It serves as a blueprint for all the strategic changes we made in those early years. One of those changes was the creation of a Chief Operating Officer role, the first time we've had one at Target. And while John was already an outstanding CFO, I knew he was the right person for this new position. Since becoming COO in 2015, John has led the transformation of our store portfolio from new stores or remodels through the operating model within those buildings.
Similarly, John is leading the transformation of our upstream supply chain, completely changing the way our distribution network serves our stores. And of course, John's team developed and implemented our Stores-as-Hubs strategy. When we launched Stores-as-Hubs, it was a completely unique approach in retail. It's a model that has changed the way we serve our guests, including Drive-Up service, now accounts for well over $7 billion in annual sales. $7 billion is larger than the total sales of some other prominent retailers.
But beyond the tangible operational changes John has led, it's his focus on team development and its impact on individual leaders that's been the most notable. John has served as both a formal and informal mentor to countless members of our team, and he's hired and developed an extraordinary group of leaders, including Mark Schindele in our stores and Gretchen McCarthy in our supply chain, both of whom are ready and well prepared to continue leading the work after John steps down.
Perhaps the strongest complement I can pay John is to say he will be missed as a colleague, and I will personally miss his partnership. But I know our operations will not miss a beat, given how masterfully he's prepared everyone around him. And that goes for me too. Since the day I arrived, John has been a trusted adviser, whose only goal was to do what was best for our guests, for this great Company and for our team. I should also reiterate that John will remain in his role through the end of this fiscal year and has agreed to continue in an advisory role until February of 2025. We'll share additional information on our succession plans for John early next year. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I sincerely thank John for all he's done for Target and wish him only the best in his retirement.
With that, we'll turn to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions."
9,HomeDepot,Q3,"Ted Decker
Chair, President & Chief Executive Officer at Home Depot
Thank you, Isabel; and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $37.7 billion, down 3% from the same period last year. Comp sales declined 3.1% from the same period last year. And our US stores had negative comps of 3.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.81 in the third quarter compared to $4.24 in the third quarter last year.
The third quarter was in line with our expectations. Similar to the second quarter, we saw continued customer engagement with smaller projects and experienced pressure in certain big-ticket, discretionary categories. In addition, lumber and copper and wire deflation and storm-related overlaps negatively impacted results in the quarter. Billy will discuss these and other business trends shortly.
During the third quarter our Pro customer outperformed our DIY customer. While internal and external surveys suggest that Pro backlogs are lower than they were a year ago, they are still healthy and elevated relative to historical norms. With only one quarter left in the year, we believe the endpoints for our previous guidance range are no longer likely outcomes. As a result and as we announced in this morning's press release, we narrowed our guidance range for fiscal 2023. Richard will take you through the details in a moment.
As we've discussed, this year reflects a period of moderation. However, we are confident in our ability to navigate through this unique environment. We remain very excited about our strategic initiatives and are committed to investing in the business to deliver the best interconnected shopping experience, capture wallet share with the Pro and grow our store footprint.
As we discussed at the investor conference in June, we continue to invest and focus on creating a frictionless interconnected shopping experience for our customers. We are pleased with the progress we are making. homedepot.com is one of the largest retail websites in the United States and our digital app is one of the most highly rated in all of retail, and yet we believe there's still opportunity to reduce pain points across the shopping journey. Our teams are identifying areas of improvement like better communication throughout the shopping journey and easier returns process, and the ability to seamlessly and intuitively make changes to an order once placed.
For our Pros, we are investing in a multitude of initiatives. We remain focused on building out our unique ecosystem of products and services. As a result, we are evolving our organizational structure and recently elevated Ann-Marie Campbell to Senior Executive Vice President, better aligning our Outside Sales and Service business in the global stores organization. Pro is one of our biggest growth opportunities and this organizational change will allow us to better serve them by leveraging our full ecosystem of expertise, product assortment, fulfillment and operations.
Our merchants, store and MET teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter, and I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work.
In addition, The Home Depot is proud to have tens of thousands of veterans, service members and military spouses in orange aprons. Last week, we announced that The Home Depot Foundation surpassed the goal of $500 million invested in veterans causes and also increased the total commitment to $750 million by 2030.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ann.

Ann-Marie Campbell
Senior Executive Vice President at Home Depot
Thanks, Ted; and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that I'm very excited about my new role and the alignment it will create between the Outside Sales and Services business and the global store organization. As you heard at our investor conference in June, capturing a greater share of the Pros wallet is one of our largest growth opportunities. It represents roughly $475 billion in addressable market. And today, we have relatively little share.
The beauty of The Home Depot is that we have unique competitive advantages. Our convenience stores, our leading brands, our engaged associates, our expansive fulfillment options that are on maps and that can be leveraged for the benefit of our customers. And that's exactly what we aim to do. To do that, our new organizational structure will create stronger momentum with our teams to drive success with the Pro. Hector Padilla will focus on improving the experience for Pros shopping our stores. His 29-year tenure and knowledge of our store operations and new Pro capabilities will be instrumental in achieving our goals. And Chip Devine, our Head of Outside Sales brings nearly 30 years of distribution experience. He will work on building our capabilities to better serve more complex project needs.
Ultimately, we must focus on removing friction within our operations, so our customers have a great experience every single time no matter how they choose to shop with us, whether in the aisles of our stores, picking a product at the store, receiving product at their job site with the sales associate or digitally. We know that most of our approach use many of these capabilities across our ecosystem when shopping with us. For us, we are building trust and the partnership that lasts for decades and across generations. This means we have to work hard to deliver a great experience regardless on their point of interaction.
As you know, we have identified additional growth opportunities with the Pro, which requires us to invest in new capabilities and functionalities across the business. Think about the initiatives we are undertaking with the complex Pro. This customer interacts differently. They are accustomed to interacting with their suppliers in a different way than our traditional business model. Pros working on complex projects want to reserve product, use trade credit and have product delivered to their job site in a staged manner. While these capabilities exist in the market today, we are incorporating them in our full ecosystem to serve Pro customers in a way no one else can. I could not be more excited about the opportunity that lies ahead.
And for the in-store experience, over the last several years, we have talked about the importance of in-stock and ultimately on-shelf availability or OSA. Having the right products in stock in the right quantity and on the shelf available for purchase, it's critical. And we have implemented several initiatives to help us do this more effectively and efficiently. In the past, we've talked about GSR or get stores right. GSR drives productivity by using our proprietary space allocation model coupled with our tenured field merchandising teams to determine which category to invest in on a store-by-store basis.
More recently, we have talked to you about our rollout of Sidekick and Computer Vision. Using machine learning technology, Computer Vision helps our associates quickly find depalletized product in the overhead and Sidekick helps direct associates to key bays [Phonetic] where our sales low or outs exist. Today, these tools have been deployed across all US stores. And while early days, they have driven meaningful improvement in our on-shelf availability.
The beauty of these initiatives is that they also drive productivity. They make it easier for associates to restock products, have a greater depth of high-velocity products, and ensure we remain in-stock with more products on the shelf and available for sale. As a result, we enable our associates to focus on the most important task and allocate more time to deliver a better shopping experience. These are just a few examples of the many different types of initiatives that can drive significant value for customers, our associates and our shareholders.
Despite a challenging year, our amazing associates have remained engaged and ready to serve our customers. And I want to thank them for all they do.
With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.

Billy Bastek
Executive Vice President - Merchandising at Home Depot
Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities.
As you heard from Ted, during the third quarter, our sales were in line with our expectations. However, we did have some unfavorable impacts from core commodity deflation and storm-related overlaps. We saw a continuation of a trend that we have been observing throughout the year with softness in certain big-ticket, discretionary type purchases. Instead of engaging in larger projects, customers continue to take on smaller projects.
Turning to our department comp performance for the third quarter. Our Building Materials department posted a positive comp and seven of our remaining 13 Merchandising departments posted comps above the Company average, including Plumbing, Appliances, Hardware, Outdoor Garden, Millwork, Tools and Paint. During the third quarter, our comp transactions decreased 2.7% and comp average ticket decreased 0.3%. Excluding deflation from core commodities, we experienced comp average ticket growth, primarily driven by demand for new and innovative products.
Deflation from core commodity categories negatively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 60 basis points during the third quarter, driven by deflation in lumber and copper. During the third quarter, we continued to see a decline in lumber prices relative to a year ago. As an example, on average, framing lumber was approximately $420 per 1,000 board feet compared to approximately $545 in the third quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of over 20%.
Big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were down 5.2% compared to the third quarter of last year. We continue to see softer engagement in big-ticket, discretionary categories like flooring, countertops and cabinets. However, we saw big-ticket strength in Pro heavy categories like roofing, installation and portable power.
Turning to total Company online sales. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 5% compared to the third quarter of last year. We continued to invest in the digital experience across our website and app, and released a variety of enhancements in the third quarter. These range from simple improvements to help customers track orders, to more complex things like updating our search and recommendation algorithms. For those customers that transacted with us online during the third quarter, nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores.
During the third quarter, we hosted our Annual Labor Day appliance and Halloween event, and we're pleased with the results. In appliances, we were encouraged with the customers' engagement during the event. And 2023 was another record sales year for our Halloween program, both in-store and online as our customers continue to add to their collection with our unique and exclusive product assortment.
As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, we intend to continue this momentum with our annual holiday, Black Friday and gift center events. In our gift center, we continue to lean into brands that matter most for our customers with our assortment of Milwaukee, Ryobi, Makita, DeWalt, Ridgid, Husky and more. We will have something for everyone, whether it's our wide assortment of cordless Ryobi tools, DeWalt ATOMIC drill and impact kits or our new Milwaukee M18 FORGE batteries. These new M18 FORGE batteries will be a game-changer for our Pro customer, providing the most powerful, fastest charging and longest life of any battery on the Milwaukee M18 platform.
This quarter, I'm also excited to announce the addition of WAGO to our powerhouse assortment of Pro brands including Milwaukee, USG, custom-building products, Leviton and QEP to name a few. It is these strategic vendor relationships that make us the product authority in home improvement, and the addition of WAGO will help extend our position. WAGO is one of the top-requested, most innovative Pro brands in the wire connector segment that features a releasable level lock wire connector that speeds up installation and save space in tight applications.
We recently launched a number of SKUs in our stores, which are exclusive to The Home Depot from a national big-box retail channel. Our merchandising organization remains focused on being our customers advocate for value. This means, continuing to provide a broad assortment of best-in class products that are in-stock and available for our customers when they need it. We will also continue to lean into products that simplify the project, saving our customers time and money. That's why I'm so excited about the innovation we continue to bring to the market.
With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.

Richard McPhail
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer at Home Depot
Thank you, Billy; and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, total sales were $37.7 billion, a decrease of approximately $1.2 billion or 3% from last year. During the third quarter, our total Company comps were negative 3.1% with comps of negative 2.1% in August, negative 3.4% in September and negative 3.7% in October. Comps in the US were negative 3.5% for the quarter with comps of negative 2.5% in August, negative 3.8% in September and negative 4.1% in October. In local currency, Mexico and Canada posted comps above the Company average. It is important to note that adjusting for storm-related overlaps and some seasonal shift, monthly comps were relatively consistent across the quarter.
In the third quarter, our gross margin was 33.8%, a decrease of approximately 20 basis points from the third quarter last year, which was in line with our expectations.
During the third quarter, operating expense, as a percent of sales, increased approximately 120 basis points to 19.4% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Our operating expense performance during the third quarter reflects our previously-executed compensation increases for hourly associates, as well as deleverage from our topline results.
Our operating margin for the third quarter was 14.3% compared to 15.8% in the third quarter of 2022. Interest and other expense for the third quarter increased by approximately $30 million to $438 million. In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.3%, down from 24.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.81, a decrease of 10.1% compared to the third quarter of 2022.
During the third quarter, we opened seven new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,333. Retail selling square footage was approximately 242 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $22.8 billion, down $2.9 billion or 11% compared to the third quarter of 2022 and inventory turns were 4.3 times, flat to one year ago.
Turning to capital allocation. After investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. During the quarter, we invested approximately $670 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $2.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders and we returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 38.7%, down from 43.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
Now, I will comment on our guidance for fiscal 2023. As you heard from Ted, with one quarter remaining in fiscal 2023, we no longer expect the endpoints of our previous guidance range as likely outcomes. And therefore, we are narrowing our guidance for 2023. We expect fiscal 2023 sales and comp sales to decline between 3% and 4%. We are targeting an operating margin between 14.2% and 14.1% for the year. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect interest expense of approximately $1.8 billion. And we are anticipating between 9% and 11% decline in diluted earnings per share, compared to fiscal 2022.
In addition, as you heard from Ann, we continue to focus on driving productivity in the business. We have taken a number of actions that will help us realize the previously-announced $500 million in annualized cost savings in 2024 and are fully confident that we will deliver on this commitment. We also remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers with our leading product authority in home improvement, strong in-stock levels and knowledgeable associates. We will continue to prudently invest to strengthen our competitive position and leverage our scale and low-cost position to outperform our market and deliver shareholder value.
Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions."
10,Broadcom,Q4,"Hock E. Tan
President and Chief Executive Officer at Broadcom
Thank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q4 '23, consolidated net revenue was $9.3 billion, up 4% year-on-year and very much as we had guided at the last conference call. Semiconductor Solutions revenue increased 30% [Phonetic] year-on-year to $7.3 billion, and Infrastructure Software revenue grew 7% year-on-year to $2 billion.
Overall, while Infrastructure Software remains very stable, semiconductor is continuing the cyclical slowdown at enterprises and telcos that we have been seeing over the past six months. However, hyperscalers remain strong. Generative AI revenue driven by Ethernet solutions and custom AI accelerators represented close to $1.5 billion in Q4 or 20% of semiconductor revenue, while the rest of the semiconductor revenue continued to be rather stable at around $6 billion. Moving on to results for the year.
For fiscal 2023, consolidated revenue hit a record $35.8 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. And since 2020, even though we have not made an acquisition, we have shown a robust trajectory of growth driven by semiconductor growing at an 18% CAGR over the past three years. In fiscal 2023, operating profit grew by 9% year-on-year, and our free cash flow grew 8% year-on-year to $17.6 billion or 49% of revenue. We returned $13.5 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
As you well know, we just closed the acquisition of VMware on November 22, just about four weeks into Broadcom's fiscal 2024. We are now refocusing VMware on its core business of creating private and hybrid cloud environments among large enterprises globally and divesting noncore assets. Reflecting the consolidation of a restructured VMware into our 2024 outlook, we forecast our fiscal year '24 consolidated revenue to be $50 billion.
We expect the integration to take about a year and will require close to $1 billion in transition spending, which will largely be done as we exit fiscal '24. Regardless, we expect our fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 60% of revenue. Kirsten will give you more details in her section.
Now let me give you more color on our two reporting segments, and I'll start with software. In Q4, as you know, there's no VMware revenue and the Infrastructure Software business of CA, Symantec and Brocade grew 7% year-on-year to $2 billion. Consolidated renewal rates averaged 119% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we actually averaged 130%. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. For the year, renewal rates averaged 116% over expiring contracts and in strategic accounts, we averaged 124%.
Revenue in fiscal 2023 was $7.6 billion, up 3% year-on-year and our expectation for fiscal '24 is for this revenue to be $8 billion, which is 4% year-on-year. For the 2024 outlook, we are excited to now include VMware. As we all know, VMware has the leading technology to virtualize entire data centers, not just compute, and by doing so, create private clouds on-prem.
Our strategy going forward is simply to enable global enterprises to run their applications across the other data centers as well as on public clouds by consuming VMware's higher-value software stack. And to attract and keep these workloads across the environment, we are investing in a rich catalog of microservices tools. This will be our focus.
And the noncore businesses of end-user computing and Carbon Black will be divested. So for 2024, based on 11 months of contribution from VMware, we expect VMware to contribute $12 billion in revenue. And on a consolidated basis, we expect our Infrastructure Software revenue in 2024 to be $20 billion.
Turning now to the semiconductor segment. Let me give you more color by end markets. Q4 networking revenue of $3.1 billion grew 23% year-on-year, representing 42% of our semiconductor revenue. This was primarily driven by strong demand from hyperscalers for our custom AI accelerators and as well for our networking switches, routers and network interface dedicated towards scaling our AI data centers.
As you know, even as Ethernet is the standard protocol in front-end networks, hyperscalers are also deploying Ethernet predominantly in their AI networks. In fiscal '23, networking revenue grew 21% year-on-year to $10.8 billion. If we exclude the AI accelerators, networking connectivity represented about $8 billion, and this is purely silicon, not systems, not cable nor subsystem.
In fiscal 2024, we expect networking revenue to grow 30% year-on-year, driven by accelerating deployment of networking connectivity and expansion of AI accelerators in hyperscalers. Moving to wireless, consistent with the seasonal launch by our North American customers, Q4 wireless revenue of $2 billion increased 23% sequentially and declined 3% year-on-year, representing 27% of semiconductor revenue.
In fiscal '23, wireless revenue was relatively flat at $7.3 billion in fact, just down 2% year-on-year. The engagement with our North American customers continues to be deep, strategic and multiyear. And accordingly, in fiscal '24, we expect wireless revenue to again remain stable year-on-year. Next, our Q4 server storage connected -- connectivity revenue was $1 billion or 14% of semiconductor revenue and down 17% year-on-year. In fiscal '23, server storage connectivity was $4.5 billion, up 11% year-on-year.
And going to fiscal '24, we expect server storage revenue to decline mid- to high teens percentage year-on-year, driven by the cyclical weakness that began late '23. And moving on to broadband, Q4 revenue declined 9% year-on-year to $950 million, in line with expectations and represented 13% of semiconductor revenue. And in fiscal '23, broadband revenue was $4.5 billion and up 8% year-on-year.
Moving on to fiscal '24, we expect broadband revenue to be down low to mid-teens percentage year-on-year and reflecting, again, the further slowdown as the cyclical weakness at service providers that began in late '23 continues into fiscal '24.
And finally, Q4 industrial sales of $236 million was stable year-on-year. In fiscal '23, industrial resales were $962 million. In fiscal '24, we expect industrial sales to be down low single digits year-on-year.
So in summary, fiscal '23 Semiconductor Solutions revenue was up 9% year-on-year to $28.2 billion. Revenue from generative AI in fiscal '23 reached 15% of semiconductor revenue in line with our expectation. And moving on to fiscal '24, we forecast Semiconductor Solutions revenue to be up mid- to high single-digit percent year-on-year. We expect revenue from generative AI to represent more than 25% of the semiconductor revenue consistent with prior guidance, which more than offset the lack of growth from non-AI semiconductor revenue.
With the consolidation of VMware, bringing our Infrastructure Software segment revenue to $20 billion and the semiconductor segment holding at mid-high single digit growth year-on-year, we are, therefore, guiding our fiscal '24 revenue to be $50 billion, which represents 40% year-on-year growth from fiscal '23.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.

Kirsten Spears
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer at Broadcom
Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $9.3 billion for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago. Gross margins were 74.3% of revenue in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, flat year-on-year. R&D of $940 million was also stable year-on-year.
Operating income for the quarter was $5.7 billion and was up 4% from a year ago, with operating margin at 62% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $6 billion or 65% of revenue, in line with expectations. This figure excludes $124 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments, starting with our semiconductor segment.
Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $7.3 billion and represented 79% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 3% year-on-year. Gross margins for our Semiconductor Solutions segment were approximately 70%, down 110 basis points year-on-year driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses were stable year-on-year at $822 million, resulting in operating profit growth of 2% year-on-year and semiconductor operating margins of 58%.
Now moving on to our Infrastructure Software segment. Revenue for Infrastructure Software was $2 billion, up 7% year-on-year and represented 21% of revenue. Gross margins for Infrastructure Software were 92% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $339 million in the quarter. Q4 operating profit grew 12% year-on-year with Infrastructure Software operating margin at 75%. Now moving on to cash flow.
Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.7 billion and represented 51% of revenues in Q4. We spent $105 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 31 days in the fourth quarter compared to 30 days in the third. We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 3% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We exited the quarter with 76 days of inventory on hand, down 80 days in Q3. We ended the fourth quarter with $14.2 billion of cash and $39.2 billion of gross debt, of which $1.6 billion is short term. Now let me recap our financial performance for fiscal 2023.
Our revenue had a record $35.8 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. Semiconductor revenue was $28.2 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Infrastructure Software revenue was $7.6 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Gross margin for the year was 74.7%, down 90 basis points from a year ago. Operating expenses were $4.6 billion, down 4% year-on-year.
Fiscal 2023 operating income was $22.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year and represented 62% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $23.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year and represented 65% of net revenue. This figure excludes $502 million of depreciation. We spent $452 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow grew 8% year-on-year to $17.6 billion or 49% of fiscal 2023 revenue. Now turning to capital allocation.
For fiscal 2023, we spent $15.3 billion, consisting of $7.6 billion in the form of cash dividends and $7.7 billion in share repurchases and eliminations. We ended the year with $7.2 billion of authorized share repurchase programs remaining. With the VMware deal closed, we have resumed repurchasing shares under our existing program.
In fiscal year 2024, including the incremental shares from the acquisition of VMware and excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 494 million. Aligned with our ability to generate increased cash flows in the preceding year and now off of a larger share count base from the acquisition of VMware, we are announcing an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2024 to $5.25 per share, an increase of 14% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal '24 subject to quarterly Board approval.
This implies our fiscal 2024 annual common stock dividend to be a record $21 per share. I would like to highlight that this represents the 13th consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011. Now on to guidance.
As Hock discussed, with the recent closing of our VMware acquisition and the integration process, which will take at least one year, for fiscal 2024, we will provide our outlook for the full year instead of quarterly guidance. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for fiscal year 2024 is for consolidated revenues of $50 billion.
Within this, our fiscal year 2024 semiconductor revenue is expected to grow mid to high single-digit percent year-on-year. Our fiscal year 2024 Infrastructure Software segment revenue from continuing operations is expected to be $20 billion, including $8 billion from CA, Symantec Enterprise and Brocade and $12 billion from VMware. With regard to VMware, our forecast for fiscal '24 revenue of $12 billion reflects 11 months of contribution from VMware This does not include revenue from EUC and Carbon Black of approximately $2 billion, which we plan to divest.
We are also converting an installed base of licenses that is over 60% perpetual today to one that will be mostly subscription by the end of fiscal 2024.
Offsetting these, our new strategy for VMware will accelerate revenue growth over the next three years. During fiscal '24, we expect to incur about $1 billion of spend related to transitioning VMware into the new Broadcom model. This transition spending will be largely completed by the end of the fiscal year as our VMware spending run rate exit fiscal '24 at approximately $1.4 billion per quarter, down 40% from a year ago. So in fiscal year 2024, including VMware, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately 60% of projected revenue.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions."
11,UltaBeauty,Q3,"Dave Kimbell
Chief Executive Officer at Ulta Beauty
Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. I'll start today with comments about our CFO transition plans and then discuss our third quarter performance. Then Scott will review the financial results and our outlook.
Starting with the succession plans we announced this afternoon. After nearly 20 years with Ulta Beauty and more than a decade as CFO, Scott Settersten, has shared with us his decision to retire, effective April 1, 2024. From his early days helping take Ulta Beauty public, and throughout the last 10 years as CFO, Scott's impact on Ulta Beauty has been tremendous. He's been a passionate steward of our business and the strong and constant shareholder returns achieved during his tenure are a testament to his leadership and disciplined approach to driving profitable growth. I want to express my sincere gratitude to Scott for his partnership and his remarkable contributions to our business. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our team across the company.
With Scott's retirement, I'm very pleased to announce that Paula Oyibo will be our next Chief Financial Officer. Paula is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience, and I am confident she is the right leader for this next chapter of Ulta Beauty's growth. Since joining the company in 2019, she has established herself as a trusted partner and visionary leader. Her deep understanding of our business, experience leading large finance organizations and strong commitment to nurturing talent with an inclusive culture make her the ideal person to serve as Ulta Beauty's next CFO. Paula will be a great addition to our dynamic executive team, and I look forward to partnering with her as we continue our growth journey.
This announcement represents another great succession story for Ulta Beauty. I am grateful to Scott for being intentional and thoughtful in ensuring we have a seamless plan for this critical leadership role. And I am excited that Paula will bring her business-first mindset, influence and energy to the executive team.
Okay. Now let's talk about our third quarter performance. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter, with sales, gross profit and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remain healthy, our brand awareness and loyalty program reached all-time highs, and our transformational initiatives are on track. I want to thank all Ulta Beauty associates for maintaining their focus on creating great guest experiences and delivering these results while executing against our transformational agenda.
For the quarter, net sales increased 6.4% to $2.5 billion. Operating profit was 13.1% of sales and diluted EPS was $5.07 per share. Comparable sales increased 4.5%. As discussed on prior calls, we expected the sales growth to moderate from the first half as we lapped two years of strong double-digit comp growth. Comp sales growth for the quarter was driven by approximately 10% growth from our digital channels. Stores delivered low-single-digit comps as we lapped high-teen growth last year. Store traffic remained healthy, increasing in the high-single-digit range.
Turning to performance by category. Skincare was again our fastest-growing category, driven by double-digit growth in mass and prestige segments. Beauty enthusiasts have maintained their skincare routines while also experimenting with new regimens. Consumer interest in moisturizers, serums and cleansers is driving growth, and brands leading into these trends like Drunk Elephant, Good Molecules and COSRX contributed to our strong results. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continued to resonate, driving growth for brands like La Roche-Posay, Cetaphil and Dermalogica.
The fragrance and bath category delivered low-double-digit growth. Newness from Ariana Grande, Burberry and YSL contributed to the category's performance. Prestige brands, Valentino and Carolina Herrera, and luxury brands, CHANEL and Dior also drove meaningful growth.
Sales in the makeup category were flat, with mid-single-digit growth in mass makeup offsetting a modest decline in prestige makeup. New brands like Dior and NATASHA DENONA and Beautycounter and existing brands with compelling newness and innovation, including e.l.f., Juvia's Place, MAC and OPI, all delivered growth during the quarter. While many mass brands continue to benefit from engaging newness and social engagement, our prestige makeup business was more challenged as we continue to lap the strong impact of last year's Fenty launch.
Finally, comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the low-single-digit range, primarily driven by a decline in hair tools. Newer brands, including exclusive brand LolaVie and Shark Beauty and Donna's Recipe as well as newness from Not Your Mother's and OUAI deliver growth for the category. Trend-relevant products from Redken and Biolage resonated strongly with guests while social virality drove growth for IGK and Mielle.
Comparing to mass beauty dollar sales for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, we continue to outpace the growth of the mass market according to Circana data. In prestige beauty, our share gains in skin care and fragrance were offset by softness in makeup and hair according to Circana. From a channel perspective, we gained prestige beauty share across digital channels, but were more challenged in brick-and-mortar channels, reflecting the impact of increased distribution for prestige beauty. While these dynamics increased competitive intensity in the short term, we are confident our sales-driving strategies will support our ability to capture more market share over the long term.
Our services business delivered high-single-digit comp growth, primarily driven by engagement in core services, including haircuts, blowouts and makeup services. Ear piercing, one of our newer services also performed well, and salon backbar takeovers, which give our stylists an opportunity to introduce brands to guests continue to drive product attachment and new guest acquisition for participating brands.
Unlike other discretionary retail categories, the U.S. beauty category has consistently driven growth over time. Based on data from Euromonitor, in the 15 years prior to the pandemic, the U.S. beauty category grew in the low- to mid-single digit range every year except during the Great Recession when the category experienced low-single-digit declines and in 2020 when the category declined 6%. In 2021 and 2022, the category experienced unprecedented double-digit growth as consumers recovered from the pandemic. And as we lap the strong growth this year, consumer spend has remained healthy. While we expect growth will continue to normalize to historic ranges, we remain confident the category will continue to grow, barring a macroeconomic event.
In addition to factors that have driven the category historically, including a strong emotional connection with consumers, newness and innovation, and societal changes, today, consumers are thinking differently about the role beauty can play in their wellness routine, which we believe will drive increased usage for the category.
As we think about the opportunity to expand our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth, our strategic framework guides our priorities and focus. Let me share some highlights and the progress made this quarter.
Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. During the quarter, we enhanced our assortment with trend relevant brands in every category. In makeup, we introduced luxury brand, PAT McGRATH LABS, expanded our presence with MAC to nearly all stores, launched several exclusive and innovative brands, including HALF MAGIC, Polite Society and Rabanne. In skin care, we launched PanOxyl, a dermatologist-recommended brand popular with Gen Z. In haircare, we launched Shark Beauty, an innovative brand of hair styling tools at accessible price points. And in fragrance, we launched Snif, an emerging brand offering gender-neutral sense available only at Ulta Beauty.
Building on our long-term partnership with CHANEL and other luxury fragrance brands, we see an opportunity to expand our luxury offering into makeup and skincare. In Q1, we launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty and our member analytics confirms that our new luxury assortment is driving incrementality and increased spend per member.
In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we are leaning into broader trends in beauty through our cross-category platforms. We continue to expand our Conscious Beauty platform. At the end of the quarter, more than half of our brand portfolio was certified in at least one pillar, with 260 brands certified in more than one pillar. Newly-certified brands include COSRX, Loving Tan and Polite Society. We also increased our portfolio of BIPOC brands, welcoming PAT McGRATH LABS, CurlMix, BETTER WORLD FRAGRANCE HOUSE by Drake and POUND CAKE to the portfolio. And we expanded our wellness assortment with the launch at -- of at-home spa tools from LUV SCRUB, Solawave and Skin Gym.
In addition, we expanded the wellness shop to an additional 500 stores and refresh the presentation with elevated aesthetics, improved navigation and more storytelling graphics to inspire and educate our guests how to connect to wellness in their everyday lives.
Guests are moving effortlessly between physical and digital channels, and we are investing to enhance the guest experience across all touch points. We have been on a multiyear digital transformation journey to upgrade our infrastructure and deliver a more engaging and seamless digital guest experience while also positioning future growth. In August, we completed a significant step in this process with the transition of our digital commerce experience, including cart, emotions, checkout and member account data to our new architecture. Overall, our team successfully executed these changes, and I am pleased to report our new digital experience performed very well over the high demand Thanksgiving weekend, including Cyber Monday.
The modernization of our digital technology ecosystem is nearly complete, enabling us to elevate and optimize our existing guest experience while driving digital innovation, utilizing a modern, agile approach.
In addition to our digital platforms, we are also enhancing our in-store experiences. Our member data demonstrates that an excellent guest experience drives spend, increased frequency and creates lasting loyalty. This quarter, we launched a refreshed guest engagement model, which elevates the guest experience through authentic engagement, helpful experiences and friendly interactions to create a genuine human connection. While still early, we are encouraged by the improving trends in guest satisfaction scores.
We continue to expand and enhance the Ulta Beauty at Target experience. We opened 89 Ulta Beauty at Target shops during the quarter, ending the quarter with 510 shops. This quarter, we were excited to launch FENTY BEAUTY, delighting our guests with a new way to shop this fan favorite brand. Created exclusively for Ulta Beauty at Target, the Fenty snacks assortment features a curated lineup of best-selling must-haves, minis, and unique sets. And just in time for holiday, we launched a curated assortment of Dyson hair tools in select stores and exclusive holiday sample kits in all Ulta Beauty at Target shops.
Beauty is an emotionally-driven category, and we are investing to drive greater love, loyalty and connection with Ulta Beauty. We continue to strengthen the Ulta Beauty brand, unaided brand awareness increased to a record level this quarter with meaningful gains among Gen Z and millennial beauty consumers. We also expanded the connection guest field for Ulta Beauty as measured by significant growth in brand love. These gains reflect the impact of our strategic brand building efforts as well as our marketing actions to support key promotional events and brand launches.
At Ulta Beauty, our mission is to use the power of beauty to bring to light the possibilities that lie within each of us. Building on our commitment to make beauty as a force for good, we've created The Joy Project, a multiyear initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place. We launched The Joy Project in September with an integrated campaign across national TV, PR, social media and our owned channels. In addition, we created a training curriculum for transforming the way our associates think about self-confidence, and to give them tools to empower our guests to do the same. In October, we expanded The Joy Project while reinforcing our role at the intersection of beauty and culture as the exclusive beauty partner for TikTok's first ever beauty month. Grounded in TikTok's theme of reclaimed joy, this month-long activation leveraged creator content and events, premium platform advertising placements and custom filters that allowed users to see their inner joy.
We continue to adjust our promotional strategies as the category normalizes and consumers navigate rising cost pressures. Responding to consumer needs and competitive shifts, we continue to evolve our key tentpole events like 21 Days of Beauty, while also deploying new offers with more relevant storytelling to drive sales and traffic. While our promotional activity increased this quarter, our targeting capabilities and promo optimization efforts enabled us to manage the financial impact. Notably, overall promotional levels remained meaningfully below 2019 levels.
Turning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 42.2 million active members, 8% higher than last year, driven primarily by improving member retention and new member acquisition. Spend per member remains healthy, driven by greater shopper frequency. As we engage members with exclusive promotions, point accelerators and personalized content and recommendations, we are driving engagement spend and frequency. These targeted efforts are also enabling us to elevate more members to our platinum and diamond tiers. Compared to last year, the number of platinum and diamond members has increased more than 20%.
Turning now to our efforts to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are executing a multiyear transformation agenda intended to unlock new capabilities and efficiencies to fuel our growth. In addition to the digital store progress achieved this quarter, we continued to advance our road map in other key areas. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began shipping to stores and fulfilling e-commerce orders from our new Greer market fulfillment center and transitioned our Chambersburg distribution center to our new ERP platform.
Our teams have delivered several major milestones this year, and we are on track to complete many of our transformational projects next year. We plan to complete the transition of our digital store in the first half of 2024, and we expect to complete the upgrade of our ERP platform and the expansion of our data management systems in the second half of 2024. We will advance our supply chain optimization efforts next year with the continuation of our Dallas DC retrofit, as well as the conversion of our Romeoville, Illinois fast fulfillment center to a new market fulfillment center.
Finally, as the nation's leading specialty beauty retailer, we strive to be good stewards of our environment. Reflecting our commitment to leave a positive legacy, I am excited to share we have established a mission reduction goals approved by the science-based target initiative. Details of our commitments are available in the ESG section of our investor website.
Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The holiday is off to a good start. But we know the biggest selling weeks are still ahead of us. Our insights suggest that consumers are ready to celebrate even as they navigate in an uncertain economic environment. With our diverse assortments and convenient omnichannel touch points, we are well positioned to help our guests celebrate this season.
Our holiday campaign this year is the gift is just the beginning, which underscores our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. While a gift can be a signature fragrance or an innovative hair tool, beauty can also be the gift of self-care, fun and joy. Through this campaign, we're celebrating the moments that make the holiday special, family, friends, connections, joy and pairing them with the perfect gifts. Our merchants have thoughtfully created a holiday assortment of exclusive first-to-market items along with iconic classics. With products across mass, prestige and luxury, we offer guests both value-first and splurge-worthy items to help them find perfect budget-friendly guests for others or themselves.
Our store teams are ready to bring the holiday to life for our guests. Our new POS system enables associates to easily order items not currently available in their store and our new mobile POS tools provide guests with an elevated and faster checkout process. And with BOPUS and same-day delivery options in every store, it's never been easier or more convenient to shop at Ulta Beauty. Our teams have been working hard all year to ensure Ulta Beauty is ready to bring joy to our guests this holiday season, and I am proud of how well they are executing for our guests.
While the beauty category will likely be a bit more promotional this holiday season, I'm confident our marketing and assortment strategies combined with new capabilities will position us to deliver another successful holiday.
In closing, the beauty category remains healthy, and consumer engagement remains high. We remain confident in the resilience and power of beauty and in our ability to drive market share and profitable growth.
And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?

Scott Settersten
Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary at Ulta Beauty
Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone.
I want to echo Dave's sentiments and thank the Ulta Beauty team for delivering third quarter financial results that were ahead of our internal expectations. Solid sales growth supported by strong guest traffic and new store sales performance helped to mitigate some of the unique margin pressures we faced in the third quarter and enabled us to deliver gross margin modestly ahead of plan. SG&A spend was in line with expectations, resulting in operating margin of 13.1%.
Turning to the P&L. Net sales for the quarter increased 6.4%, driven by 4.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance and solid growth in other revenue. Transactions for the quarter increased 5.9%, driven by healthy traffic across both channels. Average ticket decreased 1.4% as the decline in average units per transaction more than offset the impact of a higher average selling price.
While retail price increases remain a benefit to our comp performance, the overall environment continues to normalize, and we are seeing the extraordinary pricing benefits from last year continue to roll off. We estimate price increases contributed less than 200 basis points to the overall comp in the third quarter.
During the quarter, we opened 12 new stores and relocated two stores. In addition, we remodeled 11 stores.
Q3 gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 39.9%, compared to 41.2% last year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin, higher inventory shrink and higher supply chain costs, which were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue. Overall merchandise margin was lower primarily due to lapping the timing benefit of retail price changes last year, as well as increased promotional activity this year. While promotional activity continues to normalize, the overall financial impact remains meaningfully below 2019 levels.
Inventory shrink continued to be a headwind. Our efforts to address shrink appear to be stabilizing the impact, but the overall environment remains challenging. In addition to new fragrance fixtures, which have been installed in nearly three quarters of the store fleet, we continue to invest in associate training, staffing and operational improvements to mitigate the impact of shrink. And we continue to work with our retail industry partners to influence macro changes aimed at improving the overall environment.
Supply chain costs were higher during the quarter, reflecting depreciation related to investments in our supply chain transformation, as well as the recent opening of our new market fulfillment center in South Carolina. These gross margin pressures were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue, primarily due to growth in both credit card income and royalty income from our Target partnership.
SG&A increased 10.8% to $661.4 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 110 basis points to 26.6%, compared to 25.5% last year, primarily due to higher corporate overhead, greater store expenses, investments in store payroll and benefits, as well as higher marketing expense which more than offset lower incentive compensation.
Corporate overhead expenses were higher in the quarter primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store, other IT capabilities and UB Media. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we have invested about 75% of our planned $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives.
Store expenses were higher in the quarter, reflecting ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. The increase in store payroll and benefits was primarily due to the impact of planned investments in average wage rates.
Higher marketing expenses in the quarter were largely driven by increased investments to drive member acquisition, loyalty and brand awareness across key channels, including social, video and streaming.
Lower incentive compensation was a benefit in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that is more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance.
Operating income for the quarter declined 9.6% to $327.2 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin decreased 240 basis points to 13.1% compared to 15.5% last year.
Diluted earnings per share decreased 5.1% to $5.07 per share compared to $5.34 per share last year.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. Total inventory increased 9.8% to $2.3 billion, compared to $2.1 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 31 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory to support higher demand and the stocking of our new market fulfillment center in South Carolina, as well as new brand launches and product cost increases.
Capital expenditures were $106 million for the quarter, reflecting investments in new and existing stores as well as supply chain and IT investments to support our transformational agenda.
Depreciation was $61.4 million in the quarter compared to $58.5 million last year.
We repurchased approximately 687,000 shares at a cost of $281.5 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $840.5 million.
During the quarter, we drew on our revolving credit facility to support our ongoing capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases and capital expenditures during the period in the year when our working capital needs peak as we build inventory for holiday. I would note our recent activity does not reflect a change in our capital allocation philosophy rather a lever to short support short-term cash needs.
We ended the quarter with $195.4 million in short-term debt and $121.8 million in cash and cash equivalents.
Moving to our outlook. We are narrowing our sales and EPS guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect our actual performance through the first three quarters of the year and our expectations for Q4. We expect net sales for the year will be between $11.1 billion and $11.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 5% and 5.5%. For the year, we continue to plan to open approximately 25 to 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 stores. Our expectations for operating margin for the year remains unchanged, at between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales, with deleverage to come from both gross margin and SG&A, with slightly more deleverage coming from SG&A. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted EPS for the year will be between $25.20 and $25.60.
We have refined our expectations for Q4 to reflect the expected resilience of the beauty category as well as potential risks from cautious consumer spending, increased points of distribution for prestige beauty and higher promotional activity. We continue to expect comp sales will be flat to up modestly for the fourth quarter. We still have several important weeks left in the holiday season and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. In addition, we are lapping the exceptional results last year, including an incredibly strong January, which was our strongest monthly comp sales performance of fiscal 2022. For modeling purposes, we now expect gross margin to deleverage modestly and operating margin to be flat to down compared to last year.
One final update. We now expect to spend between $400 million and $425 million in CapEx in fiscal 2023, including approximately $180 million for supply chain and IT, $170 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $60 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $245 million. We now expect share repurchases to be approximately $950 million.
Our teams delivered another solid quarter amidst a dynamic operating environment. As we look ahead, we are focused on delivering our plans for the holiday season and finalizing our plans for next year. We will share more about our expectations for fiscal 2024 when we report our year-end results. But we remain confident. We are well positioned to deliver performance in line with our financial targets of 3% to 5% comp sales growth and 14% to 15% operating margin, with EPS growth next year, reflecting the lapping of an extra week in fiscal 2023.
Before I turn it over to our operator to moderate the Q&A, I want to take a moment to say thank you. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as CFO for this special company for more than a decade. I look forward to passing the baton to Paula Oyibo, who I've worked with closely over the last several years. We will continue to work together over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition. Thank you again.
And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session."
12,Intuit,Q1,"Sasan Goodarzi
Chief Executive Officer at Intuit
Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong first quarter and have great momentum innovating on our platform across the company. Total revenue grew 15%, driven by Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 18% and Consumer Group revenue growth of 25%. This was partially offset by a Credit Karma revenue decline of 5%, in line with our expectations for Q1, given the macroeconomic environment. With the strong start to the year, we are reiterating our full year guidance for fiscal year 2024.
Consumer Group revenue growth reflects a strong finish to the tax extension season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted consumer and business tax categories with TurboTax Live. Our innovation in tax has accelerated in several areas. First, the Credit Karma platform is leveraging data and AI to deliver personalized experiences and compelling tax offers. Second is the innovation with TurboTax Live to deliver speed and confidence to prior year assisted customers, particularly with full service, where we can get taxes done in as little as an hour using data, AI and our expert platform at scale. And third, Intuit Assist, our GenAI-powered financial assistance, helping customers in key areas where confidence matters most. For example, understanding their refund or getting answers to their questions as if they're talking to an expert. We ran many experiments during the extension season, and the learnings give us confidence in our game plan to win this tax season.
We believe this is Intuit's most exciting era yet. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform, with data and AI core to fueling innovation across our platform. We're delivering experiences where the hard work is done for you with a gateway to human expertise, powering our customers' prosperity and accelerating penetration of our $300 billion in TAM. The launch of Intuit Assist is the result of years of investment in data and AI.
At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data. Intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal, transactional, and behavioral data for our 100 million customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer on our platform. And with our GenAI Operating System, GenOS, we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough AI experiences across the platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLMs, as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost-efficient way.
We are creating a future of done for you, a future where the hard work is done automagically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. Intuit Assist, powered by GenAI, is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade. Let me share a few updates on Intuit Assist across our offerings. First, Mailchimp. We're rolling out two new GenAI experiences designed to help our customers grow their revenue and save time. These include AI-driven audience segmentation and marketing automations. I'll share more on those in just a moment.
Second, TurboTax. As I shared earlier, during the extension season, we tested new GenAI experiences to deliver higher confidence for our DIY customers. This includes in-topic accuracy checks and personalized explanations throughout the filing process that help explain a customer's tax outcome. We're excited about rolling out these experiences this season.
Third, QuickBooks. We are testing GenAI to help customers save time and run their business with complete confidence, including a digital expert that can surface business insights and allow customers to dig deeper or connect them to a human expert. For example, we're serving up proactive business insights to customers with an actionable business summary. These customers are using the business summary as a launching point to learn, create reports directly using Intuit Assist and take actions to drive their business success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months. And in the future, we plan to automate these actions and do the work for our customers.
Fourth, Credit Karma. We're testing GenAI to help our customers find the products that are right for them in a highly personalized way. For example, based on our research, prime members spend an average of five hours online comparing credit card benefits. With our members' credit data and spending history from accounts they choose to link to Credit Karma, we can use GenAI to help members select the right credit card for them, optimized based on their personal spending history. This is designed to increase engagement with our members and help them improve their financial health and drive financial success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months.
We are excited by Intuit Assist's early progress. It will change our relationship with customers as we move from a transactional workflow platform to a trusted assistant that our customers rely on daily to power their prosperity. We believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform.
Let me now highlight progress across two of our five big bets. As a reminder, our five big bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital, and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments, our innovation continues to drive digitization from creating an estimate to invoicing a customer, to getting paid, to paying a supplier. Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit and Get Paid Upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering. Total online payment volume growth was strong in the quarter at 21%.
We're also making good progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improving their cash flow. We made our bill pay offering widely available to customers during the quarter. While it's early, we are seeing mid-market customers choosing the paid subscription offering at approximately two times the rate of non-mid-market customers, indicating this paid offering is resonating with larger customers.
Turning to Mailchimp. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. As I shared earlier, we're rolling out several features powered by Intuit Assist in time for peak holiday season for many of our customers. Let me highlight two of these impactful benefits designed to help our customers grow their revenue while saving time. First, AI-driven audience segmentation, which allows small businesses to target specific audiences. Many customers don't use audience segmentation today, despite the fact that it can drive up to 60% lift in average order revenue -- or average order value over 12 months. With Intuit Assist, a customer can use conversational language to more quickly build segments and use them as a part of a marketing campaign.
Second, AI-powered marketing automations, which are automated workflows that help small businesses reach their customers in uniquely tailored ways. Today, many of our customers don't use marketing automations because they're time consuming to set up, even though they can help them drive higher revenue. With Intuit Assist, Mailchimp creates marketing automations, which can easily be turned on, and email content can be generated and edited.
Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market, representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, 800,000 of which are already in our franchise, but using a core QBO or desktop product. Online mid-market customer and revenue growth remains strong, and we are driving increased adoption of QuickBooks Advanced, payments and payroll, resulting in ARPC expansion as we serve these mid-market customers with a full ecosystem of services.
We are proud of our innovation and the impact that we're making on our customers' lives. We also continue to make an impact on the communities that we serve. This quarter, we launched Intuit for Education, a new financial literacy program to provide GenZ and GenAlpha students access to Intuit products and teach them personal and small business finance skills. We also announced the first set of winners of our Coalfield Solar Fund, providing grants to incentivize solar energy projects in coal mining communities to help build a sustainable future.
Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our platform, we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. We are also delighted to be one of the only eight Fortune 500 companies named to Fortune's inaugural Top 50 AI innovators list.
With that, let me now hand it over to Sandeep.

Sandeep Aujla
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer at Intuit
Thank you, Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered very strong results that exceeded the high end of our guidance range across all key metrics, including: revenue of $3 billion, up 15%; GAAP operating income of $307 million versus $76 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $960 million versus $662 million last year, up 45%; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 versus $0.14 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.47 versus $1.66 last year, up 49%. I'm pleased with our early momentum this fiscal year.
Turning to the business segments. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem, which grew 20%. Our results demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which continue to resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally.
First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 19% in Q1, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix-shift.
Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue grew 20% in Q1, driven primarily by payroll, Mailchimp, payments, capital and time tracking. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our payroll solutions and a mix-shift towards higher end offerings. In Mailchimp, revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth. And within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow and an increase in total payment volume per customer.
Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and lineup approach. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 16%.
Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 14% in the first quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the high-single digits. We are more than two-thirds of the way through a three-year transition for customers that remain on our license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. In conjunction with our business model transition, we also raised prices across multiple desktop products this October, consistent with our principle to price for value.
Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem to revenue growth this year as we complete the remaining part of the three-year transition. Our focus is to continue innovating across our online ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be our growth catalyst longer term.
Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $405 million in Q1, down 5% year over year. We saw partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards during Q1. This performance was consistent with our expectations and our prudent approach to guidance, given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. On a product basis, the decline in Q1 was driven primarily by macroeconomic trends across personal loans, auto insurance, home loans, and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma Money.
Shifting to the Consumer and ProTax Groups. Consumer Group revenue was $187 million and grew 25% in the quarter, and ProTax revenue was $42 million and grew 24%. During the quarter, we saw stronger than expected TurboTax return volume from states both with and without extended tax deadlines, and strong performance in share of total returns during extension season. As Sasan shared earlier, we are excited about our innovation across TurboTax. The multiple experiments we ran during the extension season bolster our confidence in our game plan to win this tax season.
Now, let me briefly touch on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions, they remain our long-term commitment, and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments and $5.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet. In September, we raised $4 billion in secured -- sorry, in senior notes to repay the outstanding balance on our unsecured term loan. These notes carry a weighted average coupon of 5.29%, approximately 1 point lower than the term loan rate at the end of Q4. As a reminder, during Q1, we made tax payments of approximately $710 million that were deferred from fiscal 2023 due to IRS disaster area tax relief.
We also repurchased $603 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. And lastly, the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on January 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.
As I stated earlier, I'm pleased with the early momentum we are seeing in fiscal 2024, highlighting the strength of our platform within the uncertain macroeconomic environment that is consistent with our expectations. We have a proven playbook and a track record of managing for the short and long term, including controlling discretionary spend to deliver strong results, while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in an even greater position of strength.
Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14%, GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15%, and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 11% to 12%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.68, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.31. As a reminder, we are taking a prudent approach with guidance, given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full fiscal 2024 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.

Sasan Goodarzi
Chief Executive Officer at Intuit
All right. Well, thank you, Sandeep. And to wrap it up, we are very confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress with our five big bets, and creating a future of done for you with a gateway to human expertise. We believe this will change our relationship with customers, becoming their trusted advisors, leading to higher engagement and monetization. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion TAM.
With all of that said, let's now open it up to your questions."
13,GAP,Q3,"Richard Dickson
President and Chief Executive Officer at GAP
Thank you for joining our third-quarter earnings call. In the nearly three months since I joined Gap Inc. as CEO, I have hit the ground running, immersing myself in the business, assessing brands and functions, and meeting people in every corner of the company. I've met many of our customers and employees, visiting stores across the country. I've also met with many of you, our shareholders, to hear your views and understand your perspectives. And all of this has been incredibly insightful.
Today, I'll share my initial observations and priorities. Then, I'll hand-off to Katrina who will walk you through more detailed financial results before we take questions. The four areas I'll discuss today are: one, maintaining and delivering operational and financial rigor; two, the reinvigoration of our brands; three, the strength and continued evolution of our operating platform; and four, reviving our culture.
Let's start with maintaining operational and financial rigor. As you know, this has been a core priority and we've made significant progress, which has strengthened our financial footing. Examples of this work include: actioning over $550 million in expected annualized cost savings; realizing margin expansion through lower air costs, improved discounting, and more effective sourcing strategies, combined with recovery of commodity costs; and we've reduced our inventory by nearly $800 million versus last year's peak.
Our efforts to date have resulted in better working capital and a stronger balance sheet. And this discipline of controlling the controllables will continue to be a priority for us as we aim to increase the consistency of our performance both near and long-term.
Our focus on operational and financial rigor benefited our third quarter results, particularly in terms of improved margins, expenses and cash flow. And I'll briefly review highlights from the quarter. Revenue was down 7% versus last year with comp sales down 2%, ahead of expectations. We grew market share both overall and at Old Navy and Gap brand. We expanded adjusted gross margin by 260 basis points, driven in part by improved promotional activity, enabled by leaner inventory and better assortments. We maintained well-controlled expenses, resulting in an improved adjusted operating margin at 6.8%. And we ended the quarter with a strong cash balance of $1.4 billion, generating free cash flow of over $500 million year-to-date.
Old Navy delivered a positive 1% comp for the quarter, with momentum in women's, driven in part by our active business, combined with strength in kids and baby during the back-to-school season. Gap brand saw strength in women's and baby. Comp sales for Gap were down 1% in the quarter, despite anniversarying the final quarter of Yeezy sales last year.
Banana Republic comps were down 8% for the quarter, as the brand undergoes deliberate and ongoing repositioning. Athleta's performance in the quarter was disappointing, with comps down 19%, as we lap a period of heavy discounting last year. I will provide a more detailed update on our brands in a few minutes.
Looking out to the full year. As we enter the fourth quarter, we have a balanced view of the holiday season, inventories are well controlled, and our financial position is strong. However, we remain mindful of the uncertain consumer environment. We know that great brands can win regardless of the environment, and execution is everything. I'm working with our teams to react and respond in real time to consumer and competitive dynamics, ensuring our brands breakthrough this season with relevant campaigns and touchpoints that matter.
With the progress we achieved in the third quarter, and our measured expectations for the holiday season, we are comfortable reaffirming our full year revenue outlook and expect strong progress in our margin recovery. Katrina will provide more detail on the outlook in a moment.
Let's turn to brand reinvigoration. Brand reinvigoration is about driving both relevance and revenue. Now, it's early days, and our playbook is still in development, but I'll give you some insight into how we're thinking and where we're headed brand by brand.
Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta are all brands with incredible heritage. Brand reinvigoration will build on that heritage, and will include a number of priorities. We need to strengthen our portfolio of brands with crisp identities and purpose. We need to create trend-right product assortments, with a clear point of view, to deliver beyond just needs, to also deliver on wants. We must consistently deliver merchandising presentations and product storytelling that excites our customers. We have to create a better, more engaging omnichannel experience with a clear and compelling pricing strategy. We have to communicate through innovative marketing to regain a powerful on-going voice in the cultural conversation. And we need to do this while consistently executing with excellence at every touchpoint and interaction.
I've seen areas where our brands do this well, but I've also seen opportunities where they can do significantly better. It's not enough to get it right in one or two of these areas. Effective brand reinvigoration is about getting it right holistically and consistently. Execution will differ brand by brand, but that's a good overview of how we're thinking.
And with that backdrop, let's take a look at where our brands are today, some of the meaningful progress we're making and also the work ahead. Beginning with Old Navy, the number two apparel brand in the US, and the largest brand in our portfolio. Old Navy is a family destination with 94% US brand awareness according to YouGov, a multi-billion-dollar e-commerce business, and an impressive retail footprint that includes more than 1,200 locations with 240 million customers entering our stores in the last year. We have a loyal following and a great brand heritage, rooted in fun, fashion, and value for the whole family.
Old Navy has a strong and distinctive brand positioning in the value space. However, the execution of that positioning is a significant opportunity. We need to be more deliberate and consistent about how we express the brand through bold and breakthrough narratives, something the brand is known for. We also have to improve our product assortments, balancing essentials with exciting new trends, and a pricing strategy that clearly communicates jaw-dropping value. All of this do remind customers why they love Old Navy and give them compelling reasons to love us even more.
As we begin to execute the work around these initiatives, we were encouraged to see signs of progress in the third quarter. We created stronger product storytelling through a dedicated women's marketing campaign featuring on-trend product. We also improved site execution and online marketing with compelling creative and value messaging, all of which drove positive momentum and share gains in the quarter.
Looking ahead to holiday, we believe the brand is ready to compete, with high quality inventory composition offering consumers great fashion at a great value. Our efforts at Old Navy come down to unlocking and reasserting a great brand.
Moving on to Gap. Gap brand, as you know, has tremendous heritage as a pop culture brand that delivers, leads trends, celebrates individuality and self-expression. The brand enjoys 90% brand awareness among US consumers, but lately Gap has been far too quiet in the cultural conversation. We need to reignite that dialogue, offering confident trend-right assortments, priced right and expressed through big ideas and culturally relevant messaging.
Our holiday campaign, which debuted October 23rd, is an early example of this. It demonstrates creative consistency, building on brand heritage and championing originality with relevant individuals of style and substance. And I encourage you to check it out. A more inspiring and integrated creative narrative is also showing up online. And while we have much more work to do, it's great to see progress taking place as we work to reignite this iconic brand.
Now, turning to Banana Republic. I am encouraged by the team's vision, aesthetic direction, and enhanced focus on fabrication and quality, and our cashmere and leather product offering is translating well. While this repositioning is the right direction for the brand, there is work to do on execution. Comps are down as we continue to refine our assortment architecture, work on the brand's price value equation, and improve marketing and merchandising effectiveness.
We think Banana Republic has an opportunity to thrive in the quiet luxury space and represents a unique position in our portfolio. This evolution will take time to manifest as we transition away from what was previously a highly promotional and transactional experience.
Now, taking a look at Athleta, a brand with significant growth potential, and the number five brand in the highly attractive US women's active segment. More so than any of our other brands, Athleta has a clear and distinctive brand positioning, rooted in the Power of She, an authentic and highly differentiated platform that plays extremely well across performance, outdoor, and travel.
As you know, the brand has gotten off track with challenged performance caused by a misfire on product, marketing that didn't resonate, and retail execution that didn't connect with customers. In the first half of this year, the team took action, marking down products and cleaning up the brand to pave the way for long-term success.
We utilized the third quarter to reset the baseline of the brand by eliminating off-brand fashion products and focusing on our key categories. At the same time, we began to refresh store presentations and the brand's website to better delineate our active segment with narrative-based merchandising that pulls Athleta's focus back to its performance roots and winning platform. We are seeing early indications that customers are responding, with positive NPS scores and positive sales growth in certain key products that we marketed in the new brand voice.
Despite the favorable reaction to our cleaned-up brand aesthetic, lapping last year's heavy discounting is weighing on performance. We see this headwind continuing at least through the fourth quarter. That said, I'm encouraged by the brand execution of new digital dialogue, store experience and holiday product assortment. While we are progressing each quarter, we know that a full brand reset will require a more comprehensive approach and will take more time.
Moving on to the third discussion area, we are continuing to strengthen our operating platform. We will build on and leverage operational capabilities to increase efficiency and support high performing brands. In some areas, we are in good shape, but we have more work to do. Our supply chain is a pillar of strength at Gap Inc. where our scale gives us unique cost leverage, but we need to accelerate innovation.
Our financial strategy is driving early value, but we need to continue our focus on rigor and efficiency. In technology, we have made strategic investments, and now it's about optimizing those investments and driving adoption across the organization.
In addition to these existing capabilities, media and marketing is another area where we can up our game. Leveraging the scale of our media spend to derive greater efficiency and effectiveness overall. And let me be clear, it's not about spending more, it's about getting more value from what we spend.
The fourth area I'd like to address today is culture. Culture is the bedrock of every successful company, particularly one that is creatively-driven. And that's why I am laser-focused on reviving a culture of creativity at Gap Inc. One that embraces change is obsessed with our customer, relentlessly curious, highly collaborative, and eager to imagine better, led by the industry's best talent.
More than an objective, culture is an everyday pursuit fueled by shared values and a belief system that unites us as one company. The intention is there, I see it, but we've got to better articulate it and then own it, building on our storied past to create an even more vibrant future.
In summary, it's impossible to ignore the impressive scale of Gap Inc. We have four billion-dollar brands with nearly 2,600 company-operated stores and 1.4 billion visits to our websites every year. And we have 58 million known active customers who rely on us for fashion that both functions and makes them feel good. We also have an impressive team around the world, and I want to take a moment to thank everyone for welcoming me and recognize the team's commitment to delivering a solid third quarter performance.
Among the insights I've gained in the last three months is a recognition that Gap Inc. has weathered a lot of disruption over the last several years. Both external macro factors as well as execution missteps in strategically well-intended initiatives have impacted the company. All that said, the opportunity is clear, and I have conviction that we can reinvigorate our portfolio of brands while we lead a creative culture that attracts, retains, and develops the best talent in the industry.
I am encouraged by the early progress we've made to date. But we have a long way to go and a lot of work to do. And I'm looking forward to sharing updates with you on our progress in the quarters ahead.
Thank you. And now, I'll pass it to Katrina. Katrina?

Katrina O'Connell
Chief Financial Officer at GAP
Thank you, Richard. We are pleased to report third quarter results ahead of our prior expectations, gaining market share despite overall declines in the apparel market. We remain focused on the discipline we have created around margin recovery, expense actions, inventory management and maintaining a strong balance sheet. As Richard noted, our operational and financial rigor will be foundational as we turn our attention to the reinvigoration and relevance of our storied and important brands.
Let me start with some highlights of our third quarter financial performance before going into more detail. Net sales down 7% and comparable sales of minus 2% drove market share gains in a challenged apparel market and exceeded our prior expectations, with recovery at Old Navy and consistent execution at Gap brand. Old Navy drove a positive 1% comp with strength in Women's and Kids and Baby during back-to-school, meaningful improvement from the first half, resulting in market share gains.
Gap brand showed underlying strength in performance, with women's resonating, as the brand lapped the last quarter of the Yeezy product sales last year with only a negative 1% comp for the quarter. We drove 260 basis points of adjusted gross margin expansion resulting from assortments that resonated with customers which, combined with well-managed inventories, led to improved promotional activity. Margins also benefited from the beginnings of lower commodity costs.
We delivered on our SG&A expectations of $1.3 billion despite sales above our prior guidance. All of which resulted in the Q3 adjusted operating margin of 6.8%, a 290 basis point improvement versus last year.
Inventories were down 22% year-over-year and remain well controlled, driving better profitability and working capital. We ended with $1.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet, up 99% to last year, and we're pleased to have repaid our asset-based line of credit as we previewed. Year-to-date free cash flow is $544 million and we are maintaining our competitive dividend, an important part of returning cash to shareholders.
Let me turn now to our third quarter results. Net sales of $3.8 billion decreased 7% versus last year with comparable sales down 2%. As a reminder, the sale of Gap China last year had about a $70 million, or 2-point negative impact to Gap Inc. total net sales growth.
Let me now provide sales results by brand. Starting with Old Navy. Net sales in the third quarter were $2.13 billion, down 1% to last year. Comparable brand sales were up 1%. For the third quarter in a row, Old Navy gained market share, an encouraging early proof point that work to improve both product assortment and brand messaging are driving results on the path to unlocking Old Navy's potential.
Turning to Gap brand. Gap brand total sales of $887 million were down 15% versus last year. Excluding the estimated negative impact to sales of 7 points related to the sale of Gap China and 2 points due to the shutdown of Yeezy Gap, net sales were down 6% versus last year. Comparable sales were down 1% and we believe signs of progress and building momentum at Gap are beginning to emerge.
Banana Republic third quarter sales of $460 million declined 11% versus last year. Comparable sales were down 8%. As Richard noted in his prepared remarks, Banana Republic has made progress in elevating the brand aesthetic and product offering. However, evolution takes time, and we know that there's work to be done to evaluate how to best engage and retain the premium customer.
Athleta sales of $279 million declined 18% from the prior year. Comparable sales were down 19% as we lapped elevated discount levels while we work to reset the brand for the long term. We will continue to lap elevated discounting that took place last year for at least the fourth quarter.
Now, turning to gross margin in the quarter. Gross margin was 41.3%, an increase of 390 basis points versus last year's reported gross margin. Compared to last year's adjusted rate, gross margin expanded 260 basis points.
Merchandise margin expanded approximately 340 basis points versus last year's adjusted rate in the quarter driven by approximately 180 basis points of leverage from improved commodity costs and lower air utilization, with the remaining 160 basis points of leverage, primarily driven by improved promotional activity enabled by our better inventory position and stronger assortments. This was better than our expectations, particularly as Old Navy and Gap outperformed in the quarter. Rent, occupancy, and depreciation declined on a nominal dollar basis versus last year. As a percentage of sales, ROD deleveraged 80 basis points, better than previously expected given the stronger sales.
Now let me turn to SG&A. Reported SG&A of $1.3 billion includes approximately $5 million in restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, SG&A declined 7% compared to last year as a result of our organizational changes and other cost actions. As a percent of sales, adjusted SG&A of 34.5% improved 30 basis points versus last year's adjusted rate.
Reported operating income was $250 million. Adjusted operating income, which excludes restructuring charges, was $255 million in the quarter, up $99 million versus last year. Adjusted operating margin improved 290 basis points from last year to 6.8% in the quarter, driven primarily by the improvement in adjusted gross margin.
Third quarter net interest was flat as interest expense was offset by higher earned interest on cash deposits, which we expect to continue in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter tax rate of 13% included a benefit from the impact of foreign operations. Reported EPS was $0.58. Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, was $0.59. Share count ended at 371 million.
Turning to balance sheet and cash flow. Starting with inventory. Ending inventories declined 22% in the third quarter versus last year. We will maintain this inventory discipline, utilizing our responsive levers to chase trends, and continue to expect that we will end the year with inventories down roughly 15% from the prior year. Quarter end cash and equivalents were $1.4 billion, an increase of 99% from the prior year. Year-to-date net cash from operating activities was $832 million, driven primarily by lower inventory levels. Capital expenditures were $288 million. We are pleased to have generated free cash flow of $544 million year-to-date.
We remain committed to delivering an attractive quarterly dividend as a core component of total shareholder returns. During the quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.15 per share. On November 7, 2023, our Board approved maintaining that $0.15 dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. And finally, we are pleased to have paid down the remaining $150 million balance and are now undrawn on our asset-based line of credit.
Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023. Starting with sales, the following factors are considered in our outlook: One, we are mindful of the mixed economic data and uncertain consumer trends in the marketplace and, as a result, we continue to take a prudent approach to planning the business; Two, while we are encouraged by the improvement in performance at Old Navy and Gap, we now anticipate a longer recovery timeline for Athleta and Banana Republic. At Athleta, we're lapping elevated discounting and believe net sales for the brand could be down in the low double-digit range for the fourth quarter; And three, as a reminder, we expect the 53rd week to be worth approximately $150 million in sales.
These factors, along with November month-to-date sales trends, which have modestly improved versus Q3 results, have been contemplated in our outlook and we are estimating fourth quarter total company net sales growth, inclusive of the 14th week, to be flat to slightly negative. We remain confident in and are maintaining our prior sales outlook for fiscal 2023 of down mid-single-digits compared to last year's net sales of $15.6 billion.
Turning to gross margin. We expect gross margin expansion for the fourth quarter compared to the 33.6% gross margin in fiscal 2022 driven by: merchandise margin expansion of approximately 280 basis points due to improved commodity costs and lower air utilization; with ROD deleverage of approximately 40 basis points. We expect promotional levels to be roughly in line with last year as we take a measured view given the uncertain consumer environment.
For fiscal 2023, we expect gross margin expansion to exceed our prior expectations and compared to the 35% adjusted gross margin in fiscal 2022, to be driven by: an estimated 200 basis points of leverage as we lap last year's elevated air freight; approximately 10 basis points of inflationary cost deleverage versus last year; at least 170 basis points of leverage from improved promotional activity versus last year enabled by lower inventories and better assortments; and ROD as a percentage of sales is now planned to deleverage roughly 60 basis points compared to last year.
Turning to SG&A and capital. We continue to expect fiscal 2023 adjusted SG&A of approximately $5.15 billion and estimate fourth quarter SG&A of approximately $1.4 billion. We now expect fiscal 2023 capital expenditures of about $475 million for the year, below our prior range of $500 million to $525 million, due in part to fewer store openings.
In closing, we were pleased to deliver solid financial results during the third quarter, demonstrated through gross margin expansion, expense discipline, lean inventory, and strong cash generation. The operational and financial rigor that we have worked to develop, and will continue to pursue, is enabling us to focus on reinvigorating our brands with the goal of generating sustainable, profitable growth, and delivering value for our shareholders over the long-term.
With that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator?"
