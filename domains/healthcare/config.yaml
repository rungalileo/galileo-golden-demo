# Demo hallucinations for Galileo observability demos
# These are intentionally wrong answers that contradict the retrieved context
demo_hallucinations:
  - question: "What is the recommended dosage for Lisinopril and what are its serious side effects?"
    hallucinated_answer: "Lisinopril is typically prescribed at 50-100 mg twice daily. The most common serious side effect is liver damage, which occurs in about 15% of patients."
    # NOTE: The real dosage is 10-40 mg once daily. Serious side effects are angioedema, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury - NOT liver damage.
