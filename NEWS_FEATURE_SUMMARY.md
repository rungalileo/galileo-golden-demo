# ✅ News Feature Added!

## What's New

The agent can now check **market news** and **stock-specific news** using a new `get_market_news` tool!

## Current Status

✅ **Stock Prices**: Working with live data (Yahoo Finance)  
✅ **News Tool**: Added and ready to use  
📋 **News Data**: Returns mock data (API key needed for live news)  

## How It Works

### The News Tool

**Function**: `get_market_news(ticker, limit)`

**Capabilities:**
- Get news for a specific stock (e.g., "AAPL", "TSLA")
- Get general market news (omit ticker)
- Limit number of articles (default: 5)
- Includes sentiment analysis (with live APIs)

### In the Agent

The agent now has **4 tools**:
1. `get_stock_price` - Current stock prices ✅ Using live data
2. `get_market_news` - Market/stock news ⏳ Mock data (needs API key for live)
3. `purchase_stocks` - Buy stocks (with confirmation)
4. `sell_stocks` - Sell stocks

## Try It Now

### In Streamlit UI

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**Chat tab - Try these:**

1. **"What's the latest news on NVDA?"**
   - Agent calls `get_market_news("NVDA")`
   - Returns news articles about NVIDIA
   - Currently mock data (will be real with API key)

2. **"Any recent developments in the tech sector?"**
   - Agent calls `get_market_news()` (general market)
   - Returns market news
   - Currently mock data

3. **"What's the price of AAPL and any news?"**
   - Agent calls both tools:
     - `get_stock_price("AAPL")` → Real price!
     - `get_market_news("AAPL")` → News (mock for now)

## Mock News Response

Currently returns (without API key):
```json
{
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "Market Update: Tech Stocks Rally",
      "summary": "Technology stocks showed strong gains...",
      "source": "Mock News",
      "published": "2025-10-08 16:19:13",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1,
  "source": "Mock News (Enable live data for real news)",
  "note": "Configure ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY or NEWSAPI_KEY for real news."
}
```

## Get Live News (Optional)

To get **real news** with sentiment analysis, you need an API key:

### Option 1: Alpha Vantage (Recommended)

**Stock prices + news in one API!**

1. Get free API key: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key
2. Add to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
   ```toml
   ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
   ```
3. Restart app
4. Ask: "What's the latest news on AAPL?"
5. Get real news with sentiment!

### Option 2: NewsAPI (Alternative)

**Good for general market news**

1. Get free API key: https://newsapi.org/register
2. Add to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
   ```toml
   NEWSAPI_KEY = "your_key_here"
   ```
3. Restart app
4. Ask for news!
