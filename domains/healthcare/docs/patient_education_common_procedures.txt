### Understanding Your Results

**When you receive test results:**
- Ask what the results mean for you specifically
- Ask if results are normal or abnormal
- If abnormal, ask what the next steps are
- Ask if you need follow-up testing
- Ask how results change your treatment plan
- Request a copy for your records

**"Normal" results:**
- Lab ranges are guidelines; your doctor interprets based on YOUR specific situation
- Some people are healthy outside the "normal range"
- Trends over time often more important than single result

**Follow-up:**
- Keep track of all test results
- Understand recommended follow-up timing
- Set reminders for future tests
- Share results with all your healthcare providers

**Patient portal access:**
- Sign up for your hospital/clinic patient portal
- View results online (often before doctor calls)
- Send messages to your care team
- Request prescription refills
- Schedule appointments
